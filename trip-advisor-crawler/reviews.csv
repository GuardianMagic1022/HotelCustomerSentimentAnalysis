Dishes are generous and tasty. I myself had the roast beef sandwich with a garden salad which was delicious. Breakfast is also sort of standard with your choice of eggs, bacon\u002Fsausage\u002F ham, toast and pancakes style. Would say that prices are average on the high end.\n\nOther than that, I think that the only downside I've encountered, was the enroumos amount of mosquitoes here. This is just unbelievable.

I highly recommend stopping at Ragged Falls on the way to the Park entrance. It\u2019s only about 8 minutes from the resort and it\u2019s really quite beautiful. \n\nYou are better off purchasing an Algonquin Park day pass\u002Fpermit from Spring Lake than at the park Information Centre near the west gate because it\u2019s cheaper ($10 CAD + tax).  Just be sure to return the pass when you get back to the resort or you WILL be charged $180 CAD when you leave. It does say this clearly on the back side of the pass, and staff reminded us each day when we purchased ours.  \n\nThe park doesn\u2019t close and the \u201Cgate\u201D is not any sort of actual gate.  You are required to have a permit displayed on your dash whenever you park at trail entrances, picnic areas, restaurants, stores etc. (campgrounds not included).  If you have never visited Algonquin before but you are planning to do day trips from the resort into the park, you should know that it\u2019s about 50km from the West Gate to the East Gate, with hiking trails, picnic areas, canoe rentals, bike paths, camping grounds, camp stores, cafes, an art gallery, and the Visitor Centre all along that main route.  We found it helpful to start with the trails at the farthest end (East Gate) and work our way back.\n\nSpring Lake has a motel-type feel, especially because it\u2019s directly off the main road, but it\u2019s perfectly comfortable and well-situated if you want to avoid the higher-priced non-camping accommodations in the park itself.  What made the difference for us was the restaurant located on site that serves breakfast (8am-11am), lunch, and dinner (5pm-7:30pm).  My only criticism is that the restaurant closes quite early for dinner, so if you don\u2019t always want to eat before 7:30pm, you are better off dining at one of the other local restaurants in the area that stay open later.  \n\nThe restaurant seems to be a dining spot for people staying elsewhere as well, and I can understand why. The food, while not \u201Cfancy,\u201D was always tasty and satisfying.  They serve American-style dishes, and while some items might be a bit pricier, overall it was what we expected to pay for a meal for two. We also brought a lot of our own drinks and snacks, and the fridge, coffee maker, and microwave in each room really came in handy for those times when we were too exhausted to venture out for a big meal.  It rained heavily one evening and we were able to make popcorn and put on a movie (there is a DVD player in each room).  We had a really nice, relaxing evening after a long day of hiking.\n\nThe rooms were comfortable, though we did find our king bed to be quite \u201Cspringy.\u201D  We were so tired from being outdoors all day though that we probably could have slept anywhere and it would have been fine. There are only two levels in the main building (no elevators, only stairs) and each room overlooks the lake and garden area, and has a small seating area on the open front walkway if you want to watch the sunset or smoke.\n\nThe bathroom was perfectly adequate, though be warned \u2013 the toilet paper is literally single-ply.  I suspect this has to do with the property\u2019s septic system more than it does the cost of regular toilet paper, so we dealt with it as best we could.  I would also recommend bringing beach towels or larger towels with you if you decide to go for an intentional (or unintentional) swim in the lake as the hotel towels are rather small.  \n\nThe resort sits on a little private lake, and you can help yourself to life vests and paddles for the canoes, paddle boards and kayaks on site. There is a small beach area with a fire pit and short dock as well.\n\nConsider yourself lucky if you meet Nancy at the front desk\u002Frestaurant (same place).  She was awesome! She took the time to tell us about the park and trails we should do, and where to eat, what to avoid etc.  She is always friendly and upbeat, and really understands how the hospitality industry should operate. She was like a one-woman show in the restaurant and at the front desk!  Cut her some slack when it gets really busy because she is literally doing everything on her own up front (aside from the cooking and room cleaning). She made us feel welcome every day and we looked forward to chatting with her about our discoveries in the park\n. \nOverall, a really relaxing stay and a great introduction to Algonquin Park.",4,positive,"July 25, 2016",2893 Hwy 60 Rr # 1,"('',)",Ontario,P0A 1H0

Blue Spruce turned out to be a great choice. Right away I was impressed by the cleanliness of the place.  Also, the friendliness of the staff.  We stayed in a suite.  Very spacious.  Kind of a typical hotel room set-up in that there are two beds (ours was a queen and a double); two chairs and a tv, but better because it also has a wood burning fireplace AND my favorite part is the beautiful view of Oxtongue Lake. There is also a full bath and kitchen.  Thermostat controlled heat and a\u002Fc.  TV with satellite, DVD and WiFi access.  The beds are super comfy and it was nice when I rolled over in the morning to see the gorgeous sunrise over the lake.  A watercolor paint brushed sky over the water is a great way to start the day!   Another nice way to start the day is with a cup of coffee and it was handy to have our own little kitchen to make it.  The suites and studios are in a motel set up - a line of rooms with easy car access.  Even though most all seemed full it was very quiet.  Each room has their own little sitting area outside with two patio chairs both in front to view the lake as well as another set behind where each room has its own grill\u002Fpatio area.

Nice tennis courts, shuffle board, ladder ball, canoes, paddle boats, row boats, power boats, sailboat, kayaks, water trampoline.  Or just set in one of the muskoka chairs and enjoy the view.  They sell wood for the fireplace for $3.  Very cozy.

We cooked all our meals and we had no gripes, but for a good, sharp knife.

Blue Spruce has its private network of about 11 km of trails just a short walk from our cabin and about a 10 min. drive from the better groomed 18 km Fen Lake trails in Algonquin Park. Yet, the scenery was almost identical, with snow-covered trees and branches spreading a dream-like canopy as we ski-ed. The resort trails were challenging enough to get our muscles limbered up, though obviously not as well groomed as in the Park. That is not a complaint, just my personal assessment. We sk-ied every day and got very lucky with fantastic snow conditions.\n\nSome of us even tried out the toboggan hill on the property using on-site sleds usable for free and enjoyed the bumps.

Certainly not for single travellers or couples looking for a quiet getaway or to meet other single travellers. \n\nThe location is beautiful and relatively remote and North facing. However, in the evenings one is really confined to the hotel. \n\nThe staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and functional and ideal for a seaside events based resort. It is certainly not an Oberoi or Aman.\n\nThe dining rooms are very large and busy\u002Fnoisy, with no separate restaurants for couples to enjoy peace and quiet from kids, and for a more refined menu. There is no adult bar, with the actual bar akin to a kids play area, so you will be competing with ten year old kids for service when ordering a beer. The so called \""beach bar\"" appears to be an old caravan with no views of the actual beach.\n\nThis is not a cheap hotel and takes considerable journey time to reach Ishigaki, so my review endeavours to be fair to the hotel operators and potential guests to accurately describe the hotel based on my very recent experience.\n\nI would recommend hiring a car to explore the Island noting that transport is very limited. Journey time to Ishigaki town to the hotel by taxi is approximately 35 minutes away and 5,000 - 6,000 yen one way. \n\n",3,negative,6 days ago,1 Kabira Ishizaki,"('',)",Okinawa Prefecture,907-0453

Had it not been for the beautiful weather and the pristine beach, we would have been devastated. \n\nSure, the GOs are nice and friendly, but are they professional and attentive? No. We visited shortly after the mask-wearing became optional, and found that the GOs began joining the guests\u2019 tables at dinner again. I personally find that awkward and invasive, and considering how chatty they become, am not sure if that's safe at this point. The dining staff was obviously in short, and we could not get what we wanted (e.g. children's utensils etc) while the GOs are having fun.\n\nFood tasted good but was boring, circulating the same ingredients every day. No fresh juice, and only a few types of fresh fruits and vegetables. Coffee and bread were great, to be fair.\n\nWi-Fi was another issue. Slow and sporadic. Expect to be frustrated if you need to get some work done. No prospect for fruitful work-ation. \n\nAvoid all means to use their app. Useless. Detailed schedule of events and activities are only posted on the few bulletin boards in the resort and you\u2019d miss a lot if you relied on the app, which shows nothing concrete. There\u2019s not even the map on the app; carry a paper one with you.\n\nThe overall impression was \u201Coutdated.\u201D Not just the buildings and facilities (which were completely fine) but more about things like the loud, bad music blaring at night, mediocre food that I imagine would cause a massive amount of food loss, and staff whose (at times obviously fake) smiles are rather depressing.

Ishigaki is absolutely stunning, and even the view of the emerald green ocean from the dining hall was absolutely stunning. The stay was all inclusive so it was nice to not have to worry about additional costs of food alcohol, though the additional excursions you can book do cost extra. There are definitely a ton of included activities at no extra cost, but if you could swing it I would recommend the excursions (which you can book beforehand online or in person at the excursions desk) some standouts to me were the Manta Snorkeling and the Blue Cave tour. There are also nightly shows and parties so if you're into dancing and partying they outdo themselves every time. My final standout was the staff, probably the best thing about this resort for me was how personal and friendly the staff was any time we interacted. They were always happy to help, or even just chat and catch up when they'd see my fianc\u00E9 and I around the resort. I was genuinely surprised how much the staff remembered our name and take time while they were on their way to the next thing to stop and say hi, ask how we were doing, and even follow up on conversations we had the day before. Some standouts to me were Temmy, who really helped us get our bearings when we were first checking in and point out some standouts for our first couple days to get in the swing of things. Enes from the restaurant was the pinnacle of a good server, I've genuinely never seen someone who can manage a restaurant so well and make it seem so easy, he was always a joy. Chef Mohey made me look forward to dinner every night. He was always excited to show me what he had for us that night and I was always looking forward to his station. We met Izzy at the archery station pretty early in our trip, and she was always so pleasant to interact with and the two of us always looked forward seeing her around Club Med or in the shows. We met Vishark at archery, and did a walking tour with him, and it was very relaxed and nice to chat and walk.

Now this review might get long but trust me it is worth the read, I will break it down into sections, food, activities, room and staff. Let\u2019s dive in shall we, first I\u2019ll save you from reading the whole thing for my verdict,  It was heavenly.\n\n1. Oh my god the food, I have to say that I have never been so overwhelmed with the amount of options in the menu. For every menu, you had an abundance of options and every meal was a different theme and spread of food options. Not only did you have the standard meal times, but also round the clock access to foods in the restaurant and bar. It is safe to say will be wanting for not. Food will always be available. The great thing about the food and drink is that it is as advertised all inclusive. I should mention some foods and drinks are extra, but those things are not necessary to have a good time, just if you want something a little more special. \n2. The facility has so many things to do that it can be overwhelming for people not used to staying at resorts. I was only at the resort for 2.5 days, but to be fair we were so tired from the day to day work and the travel to the resort that the first evening was a bust to join activities. We ended up sleeping early. I recommend that a minimum of 3 days are required to really enjoy the facilities. Even so we enjoyed snorkeling on the reef(saw beautiful fish), glass bottom kayaking, joined Yoga, archery competition, squash, made a tie dye shirt(shirt needs to be purchased in the resort store for tie dying) enjoyed the evening performance, enjoyed glass boat tour and went to the bar party. There are more activists such as paddle board, wind surfing, scuba diving and a whole lot of resort excursions that can be done. This is another reason why I recommend 3 or more days. (Just be warned that scuba diving and many excursions are not an included activity in your resort package, you will most likely need to pay extra for them, but even so, they are fully worth the price. \n3. The room was very spacious, sleeping was good, the bed was comfortable, if one needed to clean clothes washing facilities were easy to get access to. Over all the room was good, but I would say that it was a room that served it\u2019s purpose of making a comfortable place to sleep and relax in just before bed. I believe that most people who come will not be relaxing for long in the room. \n4. Ok I\u2019ve saved the best for last. I was extremely impressed by the service at Club Med. As a foreign living in Japan, I am used to a certain level of customer service in Japan. Japan has some of the best customer service in the world. But I think Club Med Kabira can teach Japan\u2019s customer service sector a thing or two. The customer service was so good, that when I and my wife first arrived we were taken a back a little as we had never been treated so good in our time visiting hotels and ryokans.\nStaff at Club Med are very friendly, patient and helpful. They always want to make sure you are ok and do their very best to make sure you feel comfortable. When I entered the dinning hall for the first time I felt like I wasn\u2019t even in Japan as it was such a wonderful multicultural place with so many languages being spoken, and the best thing was that there was always a staff me member that could speak with a guest. \n\nJust go to Club Med and you will see! If you can\u2019t go to Kabira try another Club Med that may be closer to you, The service, food and activities are worth the price of admission. We will be coming back to Kabira Club Med, we will come back multiple times. We also want to visit the Club Meds around the world especially in Maldives. One of the staff shared such wonderful stories and pictures that my wife and I want to go there. \nKabira Club Med is heaven and I highly recommend a trip. \n",5,positive,"April 26, 2023",1 Kabira Ishizaki,"('',)",Okinawa Prefecture,907-0453

I had a Junior Suite Ocean View (151), ground floor, with a kind a open veranda aside, with one sunshade, two chaise longues and two sitting chairs on it.\nThe room was clean and generally well maintained, but: the windows of the room cannot be opened (are fixed); the access door to the veranda had an improper and semi-damaged closing system, so by night you feel not secure; the door of the bathroom was also damaged and you could close\u002Fopen it only after hardly pushing it.\nThe place was somehow noisy, including during nights and mornings, due to the permanent circulation of cleaning and maintenance people pulling the old service carts; in several occasions the hotel organized by night kind of fiesta dinner, music included, just in front of the building unit where our room was located, with all the related problems.\nThe distance to the ocean (right line) is about 300 meters, so the view was somehow limited by the constructions on the left\u002Fright sides of my building unit.\nThe breakfast (included) was offered in Pergola Restaurant, an opened one and it was average; the hygiene of the food, the service and place was very poor since the flies could freely sit on the food, some of the the people cutting fruits and others didn't use gloves and the place was practically invaded by dozens of birds with the related unpleasant consequences.\nThe access to the beach was somehow far and half of the period one (of two) showers for cleaning the sand didn't work; the dedicated beach area was a limited one, just in front of the yard, it has shades and related chaise longues and generally it was kept clean; but unfortunately, just in front of this area, the beach is invaded by illegal shades of local people with the related illegal accessories (cars moving around and parked on the beach, very high level of music, ATV's offered for rent and circulating freely along the beach, horsed also, obviously); so, staying on the dedicated beach of the hotel was not friendly at all, not even to mention the view was blocked. Interesting to notice the the circulation of cars, ATV's and horses is strictly prohibited on the beach (two years of prison and 300 - 1000 times the minimum salary as fine according to the  Procuraduria Federal de Proteccion al Ambiente panels on the beach requesting to claim such cases, but nobody looked to care about it, including the  hotel management).\nThe Pierre Restaurant was the only possibility for lunch, it has also a small bar for snacks, sandwiches and beverages; but the offer was very limited and poor and the hygiene problems the same like in PERGOLA.\nWell, generally the Acapulco very friendly climate conditions somehow softened the poor impression, but I would rather not recommend it and obviously I'll never come back again.",3,negative,"February 1, 2018",Av.

I was terrified to go on this trip after reading all of the bad things in the news and travel advisors that tell you not to travel to Acapulco. Our friend booked their trip and called us to book right away so we could go with them and we did, then I started to read the news. Once we got there the first think I always do is go to the store to get things for our room like a case of water. The cab driver that picked me up at the Hotel baca me our personal driver and guild for the week. His name is Jose. He drives a large car and other cabbies drive small cars. Jose has 30 years expience and knows all the locals and saved us a ton of money by taking us directly to the attractions with the tour guild costs that you get when going with Sunwing. As we drove I told Jose about my concerns and fears of being there. My fear and concerns were quick dismissed. We went to the market, they have 2 Walmarts, I was very surprised. The people were very kind and pleasant everywhere we went. You would have to go looking for trouble in order to find it in Acapulco. This hotel was very good and we cannot wait to go back. The staff is all excellent, everyday in and out. The food at the beach restaurant was very good. My wife and friends say the Hamburger was the best they have ever had. I suggest you make reservations at the formal dining restaurant the day before. The buffet restaurant is open for breakfast but not for lunch or dinner so this is why you should make the reservation the day before. If you happen to go with Sunwing, you can go to eat at the Priness Hotel next store which has a excellent beach club restaurant open from 12-6 as well as an excellent buffet restaurant open for breakfast and dinner at 7 Pm. Also a formal Italian restaurant which serves excellent steak and fish etc.   \n\nWe went fishing as caught 2 sailfish, 5 sharks and 5 Mexican Tunas. Patrica who is one of the restaurant Mangers at the Piere Hotel was kind enough to make arrangements to have our fish cooked at the Hotel and a private table was made for us and our fish was cooked and served as a full course dinner to us by the staff. The meal was seunforgettable. We could not thank Patrica and the staff enough for going the extra mile. \nThe hotel was very peaceful. We had the ocean view but the garden view was also very nice. Three pools, very nice tennis courts and waves the ocean were also a lot of fun. There is a pool in the back of the hotel that is away from the main area. Very private and peaceful. I was happy to see that the hotel had one of the staff there in this area watching over you. The hotel had staff and armed guards at very enterence for your safety, even at the beach they watch over you at all times. We can walk the beach and go to the market just at the end of the beach close to the hotel. You can walk to Walmart. You are safe to walk anywhere. I played two rounds of golf at the Priness and the shuttle with take you directly there and pick you up as well. Cabs are available at the hotel and the cab drivers wait for you and or go into the stores with you. The weather is alway hot and sunny.

Our 5th floor room was spotless, beautiful decorated, with a view of the garden, ocean and nearby mountain.  We were VERY happy with the room not only for the King sized bed but also the safe, fridge (with bottled water) and coffee maker (with coffee etc supplied) was included.  The television had many channels to offer and 3 in English!! There is an elevator that we used and NEVER had to wait for.

The Pierre Bar was also very good but we found it interesting\u002Fweird that the Sunwing all inclusive guests had a separate menu ?

The beach is really nice at this resort and we had many hours of fun playing in the waves (which at times were as high as 5 feet)!!  We REALLY liked that this resort has two sister resorts which we visited and enjoyed...Princess Imperial and Resort Imperial.  All three are very different from each other and have their own appeal.  We loved staying at Pierre (smaller, quieter, felt more 'Mexican') Princess, larger, family oriented (play grounds, water slide, music and activities going on all the time) and Resort, the largest, most modern (steel and glass, remote doors) with many pools including a wave pool.  The only downside to Resort that we could find is there isn't an on-site beach so you are shuttled to a private beach club (but only on weekends).  The staff were always very helpful, friendly and accommodating but at times a bit forgetful (you might have to ask for something more than once)...but worth it!

I wanted to give honorable mentions to the following employees who embodied what the Pierre should be striving for: \n\nOliver and Eira at the front desk\nBreakfast - Blanca (hostess) Ricardo (server) and Alexander (chef)\nMauricio the manager at Pergola was very attentive and I believe has a clear vision as to what customer service should be \nPool Servers Gabriel and Eduardo \nBeach Server Bryan\nLiliana and Martha kept our rooms sparkling all week\nall of the valets were friendly and helpful but especially Yair\nWhile I didn't get to talk to them much, the young women in the Club Imperial office were very kind and sweet. \n\nI think the motivation is there and I look forward to seeing how they are doing as soon as we can get back. To be honest, the face masks don\u2019t help, maybe they could find some with \u201Cwindows\u201D so we could see their smiles. I feel\nfor anyone having to work in the service industry while covering their faces, it can\u2019t be easy to express oneself. \n\nAlso, I wish they would open more Villas because I enjoy staying in them so much but they seem limited. If unable to open more, than I recommend working on the landscaping around the unused buildings so the atmosphere isn\u2019t as dark and heavy. One of the big things the Pierre has over the other hotels in the area are its gardens and it would be nice to be able to wander around. \n\nThank you for a great week!",4,positive,"November 30, 2021",Av.

Four years ago we stopped coming because everything changed for worse. This year we decided to give it a go again, for our surprise, we found out that a familiar face came back to Pierre and we could not been happier; Patricio, he and his team went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible; Patricio is definitely an asset to the company. We felt like we came back home once again. Originally we made a booking for 5 nights, however, we felt so good being there that we kept on extending our stay for 9 nights! The hotel is doing a great job with the protocols of COVID, we felt safe everywhere we were.

This historical property has a beautiful architecture and beautiful gardens (except the horrible round convention centre that should be demolished asap). While under Fairmont's management, both the Pierre and its younger larger sister the Princess suffered of gradual neglect, to the point where they were way below Fairmont standards (compared to Mayakoba in the Mayan Riviera and the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa).  Today the properties are owned by a large mexican entertainment group called Mundo Imperial. To be honest, I did not know what to expect before getting there, but on the big picture I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nIt feels like the group is trying to bring the properties back to the pre-Fairmont glory. In so doing, both hotels look more lively and active, but still have a long way to go. \nPositive Aspects: The hotel is way cleaner than before; they finally removed carpets from the rooms, pools, while crowded, never looked dirty. Other guests (filthy people) tended to leave their garbage behind in public areas, but these were continuously cleaned by the staff. Service was very attentive and nice, great housekeeping and friendly people everywhere. Food at the Pierre was pretty good, but still not up to the pre-Fairmont standards.\nPoints of improvement: Some of the furnishings and finishings in the rooms and public areas look a bit worn. Awful food at the buffet at the Princess. Booking was a mess, the person on the telephone had no idea of the rooms available. We asked not to be booked on the older building, and that is exactly where they placed us. On top of this, we cancelled one of the rooms within the time allowed, but they did not cancel (lucky for us, we had a copy of the e-mail confirming the cancellation). Another mayor issue was that they threw the new year's eve party on the garden right in front of our room (imagine sleeping in the middle of a night club). They kindly offered us another room away from the party. This room was located in the older garden villas. The place looks like out of a zombie movie with overgrown herbs and abandoned rooms. The room only had a small window and looked more like a conditioned warehouse with a hard rock bed, thin worn pillows, furniture from the pre-fairmont era, and a minuscule bathroom with a window that could not close where overgrown herbs were getting in. No reimbursement or compensation offered for this night. \n\nI commend Mundo Imperial for the effort. I am aware that they must have made a huge investment, and while many things have improved greatly, they still need to step up on the little refined details that make it or break it (i.e., throwing parties in front of the rooms of guests who may not even go to their party, better training their booking staff, refurbishing the scratched wood, and most importantly, do something about their garden villas).   \n\nI would stay here again in hopes that it will keep improving.",4,positive,"January 3, 2018",Av.

Bear with me, it\u2019s a long review but it may save you thousands of dollars! For a summary, you can scroll down at the end to find my pros and cons.\n\nUpon arrival at the airport, we were told that Pierre Mundo Imperial is not an all-inclusive resort, but rather a hotel that decided to offer all-inclusive packages to try to get more people from North America looking for all-inclusive vacations to book. We weren\u2019t bothered by the information until we got to the hotel. The staff at reception checking us in did not speak English, and took forever to process us. We thought that the English part was weird especially for someone working at the front desk, but didn\u2019t bother too much. We received no information on how to get to our room, we ended up walking around in circles for a good 10 minutes under the scorching sun lugging or bags behind us until we finally caught the attention of a bell boy who helped us get to our room. The room we got was clearly not for us as the sofa bed was made into a second bed to accommodate a family. We asked 3 times to have the bed undone and removed, it never happened so we did it ourselves and spent the whole week with a mattress and a wooden board against the wall of the room. Our room was on the ground floor in tower F with a nice private terrace, our King size bed was super comfy, and the bathroom was a bit outdated by functional and clean. There\u2019s quite a gap between the door and the floor however so sounds travels a lot. Our room was located in front of the service elevator so we heard a short beeping sound every time it was used which was a bit annoying at night but it didn\u2019t happen too often.\n\nThe nightmare began once we got out of the room to explore the ground and have our first drink. We got to the ONLY bar at the hotel, and the staff started to explain, in espa\u00F1ol, that our all-inclusive package does not include hard liquors other than the cheapest available option of Rum, Vodka, Tequila or Gin that can be mixed in either soft drinks or juice\u2026 that\u2019s it! Same for the food menu, they literally ripped the menu out of my hand one time after realizing that I was wearing an \u2018all-inclusive\u201D bracelet and not the \u201Cpaying\u201D customer one. To make matter even worst, you have to provide your room number and name for every single thing that you ask for, and then wait to sign a receipt with a total of 0$. Needless to say, the waiting staff is not in a rush to provide that receipt, so you\u2019ll stand at the bar for a few minutes until you get that receipt. Pro tip: Don\u2019t wait for the receipt, just walk away. They\u2019ll catch up with you screaming that they \u201Cnecesita una firma\u201D. Much faster this way\u2026 then again, I\u2019ve never encounter such practice in an all-inclusive vacation in my entire life. Oh, and they ran out of ingredients to make Strawberry and Mango Daiquiris, Mojitos, Pina Colada and Sex on the Beach on the second day of our stay. I was pretty much left with Margaritas as the only option\u2026 hello acid reflux! Outch!\n\nThe service is pretty bad. You have to get creative to catch the attention of waiters at the pool, and when you\u2019ve finally succeeded in placing an order, it will take 30 to 45 minutes before you get your drinks. I\u2019m a generous tipper, tipping about 5$ USD per order, and it didn\u2019t change anything with the quality of service for us. The service is inexistent at the buffet, we did not get any drinks with dinner each time we visited.\n\nTalking about the buffet, the food selection, especially at dinner, is quite bad. Repetitive and cold food at the buffet, a ridiculous amount of flies chilling on the pastries in the morning, we tried to stay away as much as we could. The seafood snack bar is an OK option, but they ran out of many ingredients throughout the week so the menu is quite variable. We ate once at Tabachin, and had a great time. The food is decent, and the service was the best we got during our stay. There\u2019s no limit on how many times you can visit the restaurant, so I strongly suggest you try to eat there as much as you can. It\u2019s a limited menu though so you might end up eating the same thing a few times.\n\nBe very careful about what you eat, and don\u2019t forget to bring medication just in case you get sick (Cipro and anti-nausea). My husband and I got very sick around day 3 of our 1 week vacation. We spent around 72 hours in our room with a fever, severe diarrhea, and throwing up so much that we couldn\u2019t even keep a sip of water down.  \nNow let\u2019s talk about the hotel grounds and amenities. There\u2019s 3 pools at Pierre Mundo, but only two close enough to the bar that gets serviced. The resort was fully booked during our stay and it showed. There weren\u2019t enough loungers for everyone, and they have very limited access to shade. My husband has a light skin pigmentation, he needs shade in order not to burn\u2026 it was a challenge! To make matter even worst, the hotel offers a lounger reservation service. They will reserve as many loungers as you want in the morning, regardless if you are going to use it or not. We witness first hand loungers being reserved by the pool boys around 6:30am, loungers \u2013 with premium real estate under the shade - that remained empty for the whole day! This hotel will do anything for you as long as you pay them, and have 0 consideration for their other customers. Get ready to keep up very early with your alarm to go reserve loungers. \n\nOther than that, the hotel ground is gorgeous and very well maintained. \nIf you are a beach person, you\u2019ll be disappointed with this hotel. There\u2019s a \u201Cprivate\u201D beach for the Pierre Mundo customers which constitute of an area with about 20 loungers delimited by a rope. The area is on the beach, but about 50 feet from the ocean facing the public beach with a bunch of gazebo in front of it. The view is not great, and you have to walk through the public beach vendor (massage, quads excursion, body board rentals) to get to the ocean. The ocean is really fun to play in, lots of big waves!\n\nThe icing on the cake for us was that we learned on December 31st at 9:30pm, once we were all dressed up and ready to welcome 2018, that our \u201Call-inclusive\u201D package did not include access to the NYE celebration dinner. We made a formal complaint and we were received very well by the concierge who did try to help by calling the food and beverage Manager. He was rude, but did try to offer a comprise by offering 50% off on price the 200$CAD\u002Fperson. We refused as we had already spent way too much money for the service provided during our stay. The food available at the buffet on that night was fit for dogs, cold pastas, lumpy and cold mash potatoes and tasteless chicken thighs, and the bar closed at 10pm. Couldn\u2019t get alcohol anywhere on the resort after that time. In the hotel\u2019s defense, we investigated the situation and spoke with our tour operator rep upon departure. We found out that the NYE party not being included was mentioned by our tour provider representative at the orientation session the day after we arrived, but we never go to these sessions. In retrospect, I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t aware until that moment because it would have pissed me off from the get go. It\u2019s a bit too late to inform your customers that have booked an ALL-INCLUSIVE vacation, that there\u2019s MANY items not included once they arrived.\n\nCheck out was fairly quick, in Espa\u00F1ol only. I have no idea of what I was told or asked during that process.\n\nIn conclusion, we did not have a great time at Pierre Mundo Imperial. My advice to you is to seek another resort for your vacation and go spend your hard-earned money elsewhere. \n\nSummary of this review:\n\nPros\n\u2022\tVery close to the airport (5 minutes ride)\n\u2022\tHotel grounds is beautiful and well maintained\n\u2022\tThe ocean is quite fun to play in (big waves)\n\u2022\tGreat view on Punta Diamante\n\u2022\tThe rooms are decent, comfortable and clean.\n\nCons\n\u2022\tNot an all-inclusive resort, you\u2019ll feel as a second-hand guess if you purchase such package (limited drinks and food selection)\n\u2022\tBad service all around\n\u2022\tFood isn\u2019t up to par for a 4-stars hotel\n\u2022\tNot enough loungers and shade available at the pools \u2013 loungers\u2019 reservation policy is ridiculous and disrespectful",1,negative,"January 29, 2018",Av.

data/ca/150787/154284/657672281.html,Pierre Mundo Imperial,"""Just back from a week in Acapulco. We travelled with Sunwing from Montreal and chose to stay at the Pierre Mundo Imperial hotel which is one of three hotels in the area owned and operated by Mundo Imperial.  The 3 hotels are located in the Punta Diamante area of Acapulco which is also know as Riviera Diamante. This area is between the airport and Acapulco bay, and although hotels like the Pierre and Princess, now part of the Mundo group of hotels (formerly Fairmont hotels) have been around since the 1970\u2019s, the area is considered the newer part of Acapulco and is under development. There are many luxury condos being built along the coast. We chose the Pierre Mundo because we were looking for a smaller resort that was located on the beach; it only has 229 rooms.  \nThe hotel and grounds were nice, there are 3 pools, nice gardens and a lot of green space. Main pool features a waterfall feature and is quite nice. The secondary pool is larger and was a nice place to relax and take in the sun. The weather was fantastic, clear blue skies with temps between 28C and 30C (avg. 85F) with relatively low humidity. The rooms were fairly standard for a hotel built in the 70\u2019s; good size with modest decor. Bathroom was older but it was clean and roomie. The one negative about the room was that despite having a fridge in the room, it was not stocked or replenished daily. Two small water bottles were furnished daily but were left on the makeup counter near the room\u2019s entrance.   We had a deluxe ocean-view room with a very nice unobstructed view of the Pacific.  \nWe were somewhat disappointed with the restaurant selection at the Pierre Mundo. There were 3 restaurants: a buffet restaurant, a Bar type restaurant with both inside and outside seating offering mainly a lunch and snacks menu, and a formal dining restaurant (Tabachin).  There was also a convenient store offering gifts, pharmaceuticals, sandwiches, muffins and cakes along with Starbucks coffee. This was not included in our all-inclusive offering. The buffet restaurant was open for breakfast daily, it only opened for lunch on the Saturday and was never open for dinner during our stay... and this is the main reason for our disappointment with the restaurants at the Pierre. For lunch all we had was the Pierre Bar and if you didn\u2019t want a formal meal for dinner all you had was the same pizza, burgers, etc. menu offered from that same bar.  Fortunately, the positive with staying at a Mundo Imperial hotel was that we were able to eat at any of the other hotels, the Princess and the Palacio, which we took advantage of daily. We ate lunch at the Chula Vista buffet restaurant most days we were there. The Princess was a 10-15 minute walk along the beach or a 2 min shuttle that runs all day. We never waited more than 5 mins for a shuttle the entire week. We also ate at the Tavola Italian \u00E0 la carte restaurant 3 times. We enjoyed the salads and the pasta dinners and the deserts at the Tavola. Service was also great especially when we had Laura as our waitress. She was so pleasant and her smile infectious. Besides the restaurants, the Princess features luxurious gardens, a beautiful pool area with palms, a waterfall feature and swim up bar.  Pool side service was also better at the Princess. Without having access to the Princess it would have been a long week \u201Cfood-wise\u201D if all we had was the restaurants at the Pierre. Having the option to spend the day at a different pool and to go off our resort for dinner was like a night out.  \nWe also visited the Palacio Mundo Imperial the third hotel in the chain that we had access to. It was a little further, about 15-20 mins by shuttle. It was a nice ride along the coastal road where were able to see some of the luxury condos in the area as well as the Vidante golf courses. The Palacio is a modern 1400 room hotel with 6 pools and 5 or 6 restaurants, but is not beachfront. We visited one day and spent the day around the pool. The hotel was modern, the food and service at the pool was good, the pool  area was nice but in general without the beach we found it to be too hot (no breeze), too much cement and lacking charm. There is a shuttle than runs hourly that brings you to an exclusive beach club that features 2 more pools and a beachside restaurant. We didn\u2019t make the trip there so can\u2019t comment. We did ask some people we met on the flight down who stayed at the Palacio who said the beach club was really nice. They also visited the Princess and the Pierre and said they would choose the Pierre in the future because they missed having direct access to the beach particularly for morning walks. \nI would like to address the comments that I read about service and at the Pierre. There was definitely truth to the comments regarding Sunwing guests not receiving similar treatment to the locals wearing silver bracelets. We noticed immediately once the resort filled up on the weekend. I addressed this with the F&B Manager and noticed a huge turnaround after my discussion. The main reason I was told, was due to the staffs fear to speak English or French.  We did notice that a greater effort was made and that the pool staff in particular made a greater effort to serve and talk with Sunwing guests. \nSo, here is my final comment as it relates to Sunwing, Mundo Imperial hotels, and Acapulco as a destination. Firstly I would like Sunwing to recognize that none of these hotels are 5 star hotels. The Pierre is a 3 star hotel based on its age and amenities. Not enough restaurant choices, no mini-bar services, no classes, shows or organized activities. The Princess is a 4 star hotel based on its age and room decor alone. The restaurants are nice, the services are better and the pool area is beautiful. The Mexican Open Tennis tournament was taking place during our stay which made for an active busy vibe which I enjoyed but it was an obvious priority of the hotel and its staff. The Palacio is also a 4 star hotel but for different reasons; the decor and newness if the rooms and resort are great, the amenities with its pools and restaurants on par with other 5 star hotels however not being an ocean-side resort is a big miss. Which hotel would I choose if I were to go back to the area with Sunwing? I would choose either the Pierre or Princess and would likely stay at the Pierre again. Having the choice to stay at a quieter resort with access to the Princess at $300-500 less for the week is a good choice. That said having travelled to other areas in Mexico, I would not choose to return to Acapulco anytime soon. I much preferred my stay in Puerto Vallarta or Playa del Carmen. So much more to see and do and the service much better due to the ability of the staff to communicate in English. \n\n\u003E\u003E I would like to give a shout out to Bruno (pool area), Melina (front desk), Suzanne, (F&B Manager) and the wait staff at the Pierre Bar, thank you all for making our week extra special, your service and smiles made the difference.\u003C\u003C\n",3,negative,"March 10, 2019",Av.

We got this trip for 3200CAN$ end of Jan booked last minute 2 days prior to departure. Price was a big influence on the decision. We didn\u2019t want Cuba as I\u2019m a fussy eater and 2 other members of the family have dietary restrictions. So Mexico was a good choice seeing that we have been to Mexico twice before as a couple and always had good luck with food. Our kids never traveled down south either. \n\nCheck in was fine and quick. No orientation which was nice. Just a quick explanation on the way to our room from the bellman. We were upgraded from garden view to partial ocean view automatically without requesting it. The view was great! To my surprise the mini fridge was empty. Only way to get alcohol was to go to the one bar in the whole resort or buy some in their store. They only give you 2 small bottles of water per day! We were 4 people!! They said we had to buy extras...? Kinda stupid but we didn\u2019t make much of it and just stole some off of the cleaning lady carts in the hallway! Also my preferred beer down south is Modelo Negra and they don\u2019t serve it at Pierre Mundo but they do at the sister hotels. Honestly, luckily we had free access to the sister resorts because it made it worth it. When at the sister hotels you can ask for literally anything and they\u2019ll give it to you but at Pierre mundo they give you nothing so we just took everything back to our resort. The communication was really bad. Most workers knew absolutely no English. These hotels clearly cater to their own Mexican nationals. The food was good although the buffet never opened for lunch or supper. Only breakfast buffet. For lunch on site you could only eat at the Pierre bar which the food was limited and honestly sucked. They had one a la carte restaurant and it was good but opened so late! So we ended up going to the sister hotels for lunch and supper and their restaurants were WAY BETTER! The resort was really dead while there which honestly was nice. The beach was beautiful but there was solicitation and ATVs ripping up and down all day long. The whole week was 28-33 degrees and never a drop of rain. One pet peeve was waking up every morning to the smell of smoke! Really bad too. Our daughter woke up at 1:00 am with a croop like cough and we were very afraid for her, she was crying in pain. Grounds were really well kept. We also had 2 nights of concert shows happening right off our balcony until almost midnight. Was very loud and impossible to sleep but we didn\u2019t make anything of it. Whenever you order food or drink you have to tell them your name and room number and they have to invoice it!!?? You had to sign it or they\u2019d run after you. Really annoying but oh well. Our main worry is we would get a surprise charge at departure but we went to reception and cleared that up early on so we could enjoy our trip without the feeling that we were going to get a huge surprise at check out! Every night was a gorgeous sunset! Pics attached. All in all I would suggest this place but keep in mind that you get what you pay for. I feel we got our money\u2019s worth. Also we were stolen from. Every day we found that some of our dirty clothes had gone missing. The wifi was great in room and throughout resort.

All were always smiling and willing to help. Special thanks to Adan at the pool, who helped me every morning and always asked me if I needed anything else.\n\nThe kids club was also good. The best indicator was my six-year-old, who spent every day playing with them, happy and excited with all their kids' activities.\n\nOliver at the front desk also helped us set up a charming yacht trip. He was responsive and always asked about how to help more.\n\nWhat was not ok:\n\n1. The Check-in process was a nightmare. I didn\u2019t have to wait in any line, but the process took at least 20 minutes. Besides that, I arrived at 4:30 pm, and my room wasn\u2019t ready.\n2. The room had many issues. We were in a bungalow, and the mosquito screens were broken, the air condition was not working correctly in the living room, the outdoor lights of our pool area didn\u2019t work, and the safety box just worked for one day. We asked for these things to be fixed, and they were not set (they didn\u2019t even try)\n3. I came five years ago, and I remember how great the food was, and this time I can\u2019t say the same. Breakfast was good, but the rest of the meals were not good at all\n4. We rented the tennis courts for two days. On the second day, my wife didn\u2019t bring the receipt, and the staff was rude at her, and they asked her to go back to the cafeteria and ask for a new ticket. They didn\u2019t even use their radio to confirm the payment\u2026 it would be so easy, but not\u2026 they wanted my wife to walk back to the lobby area and repeat the process.\n5. The coffee shop used to open at 6:30 am, and now it opens late, variety is limited, and they use two different devices to do the charges.. very shady. Food uses one machine to charge, and other products use a different device to register the transaction. This process was not only inefficient but shady.\n6. We needed an extra bed in our room, I called housekeeping, but they asked me to call the front desk, then the front desk asked me to call housekeeping.

Coming in, i was excited, and the lady at the front desk was very nice. I took a non-electrical tent site, which was very cheap (around 20$) per night. I was the only one in the tent area, but they decided to give me the campsite situated next to the main road, and the only entry into the tent area. The site was big, but i had absolutely no privacy, as there were minimal trees and i had roads on three sides. A bag of wood was 10$, which i found expensive, but necessary. \n\nMy first night, i was kept awake until 1:30AM by very loud, disruptive drunk seasonal campers. Nothing was done, and i had to block out the noise to fall asleep. My second day (saturday), i headed to the park store to get wood, only to see a sign saying it was closed due to a family emergency. Understandable, i was not angry about it. The problem, though, is that the store was closed for the next two days too. They forbid outside wood into the park, and i relied on a fire to cook my meals and heat water, but couldn't buy any because the store was closed. Monday morning, i headed to the store to check out and get my 20$ deposit back. You needed to give a mandatory deposit in order to receive a key card to get into the park.

Within a few minutes we were brought a couple of metal chairs and a table - not quite the same quality or comfort as the other suites had but suitable. Mentioned the heat seemed not to work and they were at our door almost instantly. Maintenance came by when requested when there was an issue with the tub. Bed was extremely comfortable. \nCons: Terrace Rooms (the pet friendly rooms) need updating! The rooms need to be repainted. The shower install was worn. The only TV in the unit was small and a fair distance from the seating area - so old eyes had a hard time seeing or reading any subtitles. The main bedroom bed was a little big with the built in base to be able to navigate around. Not enough lights - could use one on the side table in the seating area (other than the floor lamp or overhead light) The main bedroom could use a light on both night tables and the second bedroom could also use a table light. It seems that there is a rely upon overhead lighting. \n\nIt was disappointing to arrive and have the reception not wearing a mask (even though they had a small partition by the front of the desk) the receptionist leaned around it to serve us and definitely was not 6 feet away.

(Kellys Rd.) next to lock 45.\n\nThere are numerous restaurants in the area, one onsite (more formal) and the other called \u201CThe Grill\u201D 50m away was more bar food.  We tried both and both were great.  Upper scale but worth it.  The kids ice cream at the floating Icebreaker boat.  The portions were generous and price reasonable.  \n\nWe lucked out when we were there, there was a wedding on the grounds and a reception in the main building.  After dinner, we asked if we could dance with the bride\u2019s wedding party \u2013 she obliged.  We really enjoyed the dancing, especially the kids.  \n\nSome noted features:\n1)\tLight house\n2)\tLCBO 50m away\n3)\tRestaurants (Lighthouse, The Grill, Icebreaker) \n4)\tSpa\n5)\tLoft suites (highly recommended).  Private, spacious, luxurious fixings & Little Lake direct access \n6)\tPicturesque setting (lake, sunset, lock, resort facilities, etc.)\n7)\tStaff accommodation \u2013 generally friendly \u002F helpful\n8)\tVarious nearby marina\u2019s for seadoo \u002F boat rentals - less than 1km away\n9)\tProximity to Toronto   \n10)  Electric car charging stations\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our stay.  We needed a time out from the City and to reconnect with nature. This resort offered the best of both worlds.  It is well connected to services (restaurants, wifi, LCBO, general store, ice cream) and accompanied with some higher quality touches (linens, spa, service, etc.).

COVID protocols taken seriously. Only niggles: the Trent Suite is above the fire pit and patio and can be a bit noisy if you are sitting on the balcony; presumably because of the short-staff issue (common everywhere this summer), the menu is limited especially after the third dinner in a row.

The restaurant and room amenity quality is not there. The room: toiletries, coffee, towels and bedding are sub par. The coffee is not drinkable. Quality resorts provide a Nespresso machines these days. The toiletries are such poor quality I went out and bought soap and shampoo. I have never had to do that, ever. It is 2 star quality at best. Towels are paper thin and bedding is rough. Upgrading the quality in these items will make a huge difference. The cost is not high compared to clients and reputation you will lose by not providing quality products. Also provide robes. Most resorts do. \n\nThe restaurant:  the beverages, wine and food need an upgrade. It is 3 star quality. There was not a single IPA or decent craft beer on the list. They serve Martini and Rossi as the red vermouth which no quality bar serves these days. Dolans or any other local quality brand is the standard. They use ocean spray cranberry juice. That is not even cranberry juice, it\u2019s a sub par cocktail mix. Buy quality ingredients! Take a tip from the little coffee shop across the street and look at cocktails they serve. Everything they serve there is quality. Why? Because they use good ingredients. Providing top notch cocktails is a thing these days. People love it. You also have no decent wines by the glass and overall the wine list is not great. I heard that a new beverage manager started recently so I hope they understand how to kick it up a notch. \n\nAnd finally, the food. The menu needs improvement. You don\u2019t need a big selection, but offer a bit more variety. There should always be a chicken, beef and fish dish (not fish and chips - rock fish- that\u2019s a lunch item). Offer other styles of potato than French fries. And improve the quality. I had the pasta with shrimp and it was not good.  Frozen small shrimps, no flavour in the sauce and no decent Parmesan served with it (they did provide something better when I mentioned it). The standard in good restaurants is Regianno. The burgers were fine. My husband had the steak which he thought was good. The menu needs an overhaul. Halibut and decent quality shrimps should be on the menu. Better appetizers. And maybe a bit of creativity. \n\nThey have a pianist on Fridays and Saturdays which is a great idea. That was enjoyable. \n\nMy feedback is not just personal preferences; it is free advice (from a foodie and someone that has stayed in many hotels) so the resort can realize its full potential.

The furnishings were well appointed, the bed very comfortable, large shower.  Kitchenette was a well stocked for what we needed.  The balcony was extra large and while too cold to spend a great deal of time out there, the balcony provided a gorgeous view from the second floor.  The spa was fully booked so we were not able to enjoy the services - will save that for next time.  \n\nThe property is very pretty, nicely landscaped and very clean.  The interior is very welcoming, clean and organized nicely.  The dining room and bar area is so pretty and inviting.  During these COVID times, the staff made it safely feel like things were as they once were.  \n\nThe food was very good.  Our only complaint regarding the dining experience would be a couple things:\n1. We felt rushed during dinner.  No sooner were we seated and ordered, our apps arrived followed very quickly thereafter with our dinner.  Would have been nice to enjoy the atmosphere (especially with the piano entertainment) between courses.\n2. A bread basket would be a really nice addition as you are seated\n3. The menu selections are wonderful, however, they go unchanged aside from the soup of the day.  If you are enjoying the dining room for 3 nights it would be nice to have a new addition, perhaps consider a feature dish of the day.\n\nThe staff were all wonderfully friendly, welcoming and pleasant to talk with.\n\nWe will most definitely be returning in the warmer weather!!\n",4,positive,"November 23, 2020",2900 Kellys Road P.O.

Directly across the road is an LCBO, a nice grocery store and variety store both with great Muskoka wear and gifts, and there is also a fantastic place for a casual breakfast or lunch (the Cabin) and coffees which is super charming. \n\nWhile not ideal for lake swimming, the pool and hot tub are impeccably clean and perfect temperature. it might have been a nice addition to be able to have a canoe or kayak to use, but this is a place to relax and chill fwithout effort, not so much an activity based experience.

This summer, I decided I\u2019d join in the annual family vacation, but I also headed out to Sunnylea for a second time with a group of my friends who had never previously been there. Nothing but complete positives, from myself as always, but also from all my friends. There are plenty of amenities located on the resort that are good for all ages. Some of these things include paddleboats, kayaks, canoes and a rowboat, all included in the price of the stay. You could also rent a fishing boat for a very affordable cost, and take it out to do some fishing; which I always do as the fishing is great! The fishing boats are always kept well maintained and clean, the gas tanks are always filled, the safety package is in the boat, lifejackets are offered for use in the boat house, and Hap (owner) will always gladly show you around and make sure you know how to properly and safely operate the boat. Other amenities we really enjoyed were the pool, the firepit, and the extremely well kept grounds with lots of space to play sports such as baseball, football, soccer, etc. The cottages themselves are very welcoming and homey. I have stayed in majority of the cabins, and all are well maintained and cozy. Even the very few times that we did run into problems with something in our cottage, Shirley and Hap were very quick at attending to these problems and fixing them immediately. Shirley and Hap are extremely great people. They take all of their guests, and treat them as family. They make sure everyone feels welcomed, safe, and relaxed. There have been many times where we invite Shirley and Hap over for dinner and drinks, and simply enjoyed our nights together. They are very fun people to be around. Those who have claimed they have had a terrible experience may not understand that Sunnylea Resort is located in a very small, cozy town. Everyone knows everyone, which is why everyone is so welcoming and friendly. It seems as if many people mistaken the friendliness found through the owners as invasive, yet I have never found either owner invasive or a nuisance. They simply are great people, running a great business, and offering a place for families to get away and enjoy some time away from your everyday life.

The beds in the children's room were covered in small black bugs. Kids had to sleep on the couch. The following morning this info was shared with the owners. At first we were told an exterminator would be there within an hour. (This was 8am) No one arrived until late in the afternoon. I then had to show the exterminator where the bugs were because he said there weren't any... There were.... Hundreds of them. He claimed they were some type of mite and it wasn't a big deal. They were only on the beds so the owners swapped out the bedding and said things were fine. \nThe owners did offer to refund our remaining nights or set us up in a smaller cabin. We said we wanted to wait on the exterminator because we wanted to know what the bugs were, and we had gone with a larger group. By the time the exterminator arrived, it was too late to think about leaving. The smaller cabins would have meant our kids slept in one by themselves and we weren't willing to do that. \nWhile waiting for the exterminator I asked if we could do some laundry as all our clothes and bedding had been exposed to bugs. We weren't allowed to use the on-site facilities. I asked about a laundromat in town. The owner didn't know where it was... Google search revealed it was 800 meters down the road... I feel the owners should have known that. \nAfter swapping bedding we tried to stay a second night but the bugs were still there. We left the following morning. The owners refunded us the nights we didn't stay.\nNot once did the owners apologize for a horrible experience or offer to pay for our laundry or the ruined nights. We felt like they didn't believe their unit had bugs in it... Overall a very poor customer service experience and I would not recommend this resort to anyone.\nI will say the pool was nice and the grounds were clean. The beach was not swimmable. We were told there were no boats available for rent. The weeds around the water were so thick that fishing was not possible.

data/ca/1144943/2103327/379344501.html,Sunnylea Resort,"""Booked two nights with my partner in cabin 14 at the end of May. Sunnylea is easily located right off highway 400 at Port Severn on Port Severn Rd North. We were impressed by the semi-beachfront property and abundance of recreational facilities including free use of canoes and paddleboats, lots of sporting equipment (ping pong, beach volleyball, badminton, a playground, a basketball net [sort of defunct], and an outdoor pool). Could see this being an excellent way to occupy kids and host a family.\n\nWe arrived early and managed to coax Hap (co-owner) out of his house (also where the office is located). Our cabin was ready and he registered us. We took a nice paddle around the marina and bay before settling in for dinner using one of the free BBQ\u2019s provided on property. There was one family staying in an adjacent cabin who left the following day, so we felt like we had the property to ourselves (I assume it gets busier closer to summer).\n\nI have a couple of complaints about Sunnylea. The first is on the lack of presence of any staff during our stay, despite repeated attempts to find someone. After checking in, it seems as though Hap and Shirley disappeared. We looked for them while attempting to locate a fan (our cabin was not air conditioned and terribly hot), trying to find the WIFI password, and inquiring about local eateries, all on separate occasions and during posted \u2018business hours\u2019, but to no avail. We did end up solving each problem on our own, but could have definitely used the support of a couple locals to make it easier. My only contact with anyone during our stay was over email with Shirley, who had apparently mixed up our reservation dates and didn\u2019t know we were staying the second night. Couldn\u2019t even find someone when we checked out at 10am. Kind of sloppy if you ask me.\n\nThe second complaint is about accommodations. We went for the \u20181-bedroom cabin\u2019 as there were only two of us. As expected, the cabin was quite tiny \u2013 consisting of a small room with a bed and side table, some crude cooking equipment, and a bathroom. This is all fine for us \u2013 we don\u2019t require much \u2013 but the cabin was quite dated. Worse, our bed was disgusting and full of crumbs from past visitors. I know Georgian Bay\u002FMuskoka is expensive, but if you\u2019re going to charge me $120 a night for this, at least try to keep it clean. Not worth the money!\n\nThere are many reasons why Sunnylea could be a top accommodation in its own region \u2013 facilities, location, family-friendliness \u2013 but for the reasons cited above, it isn\u2019t. The unfortunate part is that these reasons (cleanliness, customer service, price) are so easily under the control of the keepers. I hope they can make the proper amendments to realise the potential of the property. Until then, I don\u2019t know if I would consider going back. \n\nPros:\n-Many recreational facilities\n-Nice property in good location\n\nCons:\n-Poor\u002Fnon-existent customer service\n-Facilities are dated \n-Cleanliness is an issue",2,negative,"June 3, 2016",117 Port Severn Rd,"('Port Severn',)",Ontario,L0K 1S0

We watched the boats and float planes on the waterways, ate lots of delicious Kawartha Diary ice-cream, taught our daughter how to somersault in the pool, enjoyed some canoeing and paddle boating, and generally just had a lot of fun.\n\nBad: cleanliness was lacking (hairs in the shower stall); things are not well stocked (common kitchen utensils are missing, hard to track down the owners to replace the empty propane tank at dinner time); the play structure for kids is not up to safety standards (e.g. a swing was attached only on one side); the cottages are very close to a busy road with loud motorcycle noises at all times of the day; be ready for second-hand smoke as there are no rules governing smoking in the common areas. With some improvising on our part and vigilance on the kids' part, we made things work safely.\n\nUgly: Shirley (the owner) and her nephew regularly get drunk and rowdy at the fire pit until the wee hours in the morning, preventing the surrounding cottages from sleeping. Our experience was that we got woken up from a fitful (due to loud conversations at the fire) sleep at 1:30am due to very loud shouting and laughter from the fire pit. They were so loud that they didn't hear my husband asking from the porch (15m away) to keep it down. When he went closer to ask again, Shirley took a break from telling her story to say \""Shut Up\"" and resumed talking. We could tell from the demeanour that everyone at the fire was very drunk. We then had to endure the noise for another hour before everyone finally went to bed. The next morning Hap (Shirley's husband) did not seem at all surprised when we told him about what happened. In chatting with other cottagers, they told us that Shirley and her nephew were very loud at the fire on a different night. We are in no ways prudes who don't enjoy a few drinks ourselves, but we don't think anyone should abandon their business ethics and let their own drinking take away others' rights to enjoy a weekend away. It is very difficult to make things work when the person who is supposed to enforce the 11pm quiet time rule was the main culprit.\n\nIn summary, we would not recommend Sunnylea to our friends with young families despite the fun we had.

(well, really its just a big giant lake) so we arrived at around 10nish and we walk around and try to look for a rental bike but we stumble upon Nancy Island which they have a event\u002Fcelebration kinda like a cultural war reenactment where residence of wasaga beach will dress up and live on Nancy island for a week to live like where is was during 1812. it was perfect coz it was their last day. it totally feels like you went back in time... until i saw pocahontas using her cellphone and took a selfie of herself.\nbut it was a great experience. so we had lunch at wasaga then went to our cottage. the cottage itself was.... well, what can i say... its not really that great but its all about location... so we just drop our bags and explore the area... they have wide open space for campfire, volleyball, play area for liitle kids, bbq's and the lake was beautiful. they have rental boats, pedal boats. (i ask my wife to go pedal boating with me coz i thought its kinda romantic, then i realize i dont know how to maneuver it. so it turns out she is a better boat driver or maneuver-rer than me.) then we went out of the cottage and check out the neighborhood. we went to port severn park where we have a better look at the lake, water was cold but it was great. it was an Instagram scenery! i wanted to go back to our cottage coz i want to try my very first barbecue experience which i suck at it... it was a failure, half of my Chicken barbecue was undercook and have to use the other bbq grill coz mine ran out of gas...good thing the grill is still hot when i reallize it was undercook i had to grill it again.... but anyway it was a pretty good day. at night time, the tv was not working but it was okey we have playing cards and game board and my beer so it was okey... and ohh they have wifi... it was not the strongest but its better than nothing. sleeping was a little bit creepy i guess thats part of the cottage life experience... our room smell like an old barn and have spiderwebs all over... the next day i cook breakfast, bacon and eggs and sausage kinda what you see on the IKEA breakfast menu. then we went to Castle Village and the Enchanted kingdom Park in the town of Midland. it's a nice place to kill the time and just enjoying the area.. so we went back on our last night on sunnylea.. although we are going home on the next day... but we went out with a bang...(FIREWORKS) it was actually our neighbors fireworks we just went out and join them for smores. So to end this review... the place is not really important to us, it depends on what you want. we went there for the location. a place where we can go somewhere and bring home lots of experience and memories. i may not say a lot of good things about sunnylea but i can say a lot of thing about the place.. its close to places we wanna go... one more tip though. if you wanna go out to eat, you can just walk to\nPetro-Canada its a huge gas station that has Tim hortons, pitapit, hero burger, and pizzaville. its just along lone pine road and Mintin's lane.. so if ever you wanna go there i hope you have the same reason as mine.",3,negative,"October 16, 2015",117 Port Severn Rd,"('Port Severn',)",Ontario,L0K 1S0

data/ca/1144943/2103327/165977219.html,Sunnylea Resort,"""This resort has many advantages other housekeeping cottage resorts or single cottages don't have: the grounds are very well maintained and very clean, the cottage that we stayed in was very clean and cozy, and it was pleasant to be there; the resort has extra amenities as a pool - true, small, it doesn't work for laps, but for playing with the kids is fine; the pool area is tastefully done with lounge chairs, flowers, bar plot, thermometer, clock; there are people who clean and maintain the resort hired by the owners; there are a number of interesting things to see and do in the area (they can be accessed from another resort\u002Fmotel etc); there is a kid's playground, sand box, table tennis, horse shoes.\n\nThe obvious disadvantages for me:\n\n- too close to highway 400 - about 500m. I could hear the hum of the highway from my bedroom and had to sleep with window almost closed;\n- motor boats leaving and coming or hanging with their motors on by the dock: the smell of gas penetrates around the resort, as well as the noise. If you are looking for a calm place surrounded only by nature, that is not your best bet;\n- the beach is small and the water is full of weeds - unswimmable, if you care for that (I do).\n\n- And the Core of the Matter: dealing with Shirley. I did not appreciate the way Shirley does business from the very beginning - she had sent me confirmation for two nights instead of one, for double the price, which she corrected after I called her second time. That was OK. Next, she specifically indicates on her web site and confirmation email, that they prefer payment in cash. In many places like that, when you pay in cash, you can negotiate not being charged tax - the tax is for the government after all, but the government will not know about those cash payments that people prefer because they don't have to declare them as income. Shirley collected all the cash, the price + the tax, and didn't even give us a receipt! Since we were leaving on Monday of a long weekend, and it was likely that there weren't people coming after us, I asked her if we could stay a couple of hours longer past the 11 am check out time. She said she will check and will let us know. I was wondering where she would check, because we were already in the office, and one would expect that any booking information was kept there; but of course I couldn't know for sure. When I called her initially on the phone, she knew right away she had available cottage for the two days\u002Fone night I requested, and which number the cottage was. My friend and I decided to go back to the office and at least ask for receit. Shirley wasn't pleased about this, said we cannot use the receipt for tax purposes, and gave us a piece of paper that you and I can print out of our own printers, and wrote the amount we paid on it - no number, no copy for her, basically just a fake piece of paper to shut us up.\nShe also said after that, she checked and there were other people coming to our cottage after us - so we do need to leave the cottage at 11 am, but we can stay in the resort. We already doubted that, but decided to follow the rules - we were out of the cottage the next day by 11; however none of the cleaning staff rushed into it to clean it and no other people showed up until we left about 12:30...I thought that our request wouldn't cost them anything extra and will make it more convenient for us to use up the morning, have lunch and then leave - it it appears that we had annoyed Shirley with our request for a receipt and she had reciprocated by refusing a simple convenience for us.\n\nI am definitely not going back there - Ontario is huge and there are so many other nice places to stay.\n\nIf you mind being charged tax that is obviously pocketed by the owners, and dealing with an unpleasant woman that doesn't seem to care about your impression of the resort, then you'd be better of finding another one of the multitude of choices in the area.",2,negative,"July 1, 2013",117 Port Severn Rd,"('Port Severn',)",Ontario,L0K 1S0

The cottage stunk, the beds were uncomfortable, the bathroom was a joke. The shower barely fits 1 person and the tub had dead ants. Needless to say our first night was miserable.

data/ca/1144943/568482/4070586.html,Severn Lodge,"""Our family of two adults, preteen and a teen stayed for a week this summer because the resort we usually went to every summer was torn down.  I guess we expected this one to be the same.  It wasn't, but that's not the resort's fault.  It's on a grassy lake on the cusp of the Muskoka and Georgian Bay areas, unlike our other resort which was on a clear, pristine lake with a sandy beach.  So the lake swimming wasn't the best.   However, it was so hot that it was refreshing to have a swim.  The one pool was crowded with small kids and as warm as bathwater (and something else?), so was impossible to swim in most of the time.  An old post card showed that the pool used to be bigger but part of it was made into a hot tub which wasn't functioning for much of our stay.  Our room was adequate, but quite dark because it was back in the trees.  We had a nice screened-in porch, however.  We missed the cabin we'd had in previous years, especially since a family with two young kids next door made a lot of noise.  The youngsters would be running up and down the length of their unit by 7 a.m. and banging the screen door!  Our 12-year-old met another girl her age and they participated in the kids club for the last part of the week, but our 14-year-old was literally bored to tears and spent most evenings racking up a horrendous long-distance bill on her cell phone calling her friends!  There were very few teens there and nothing organized for them.  The evening entertainment was okay, but most shows were sparsely attended.  The food was good at lunch and dinner, but the buffet breakfasts were exactly the same every day except for the way the eggs were done (scrambled one day, poached the next, etc.)  There was no grapefruit juice unless you asked for it and you also had to request toast.  Supplies kept running out, such as chocolate milk, whole wheat bread for toast, freshly ground pepper, tonic for gin and tonic, etc.  The outdoor BBQ lunches were wonderful and we loved how you could order a drink from any table, chair or beach blanket on the property!  The boat fellow was surly and seemed to be truly unhappy.  Apart from a noticably big turnover of young, summer staff the employees were pleasant and service quite good, except for slowness in the dining room.  The air-conditioning unit in the dining room was broken for a couple of days, so meals weren't the most comfortable experience, especially because the resort was rationing ice!  The air conditioner in our room didn't work for the first couple of nights because the remote control was broken, but the staff eventually installed another unit that worked fine, but was so noisy I had to use my earplugs to sleep!  Overall, we enjoyed Severn Lodge, but if my husband and I return, we'll ask for a brighter, quieter room with a view, send our kids to camp that week, and book a time that didn't offer a discount for families, so that maybe there would be fewer kids in the pool!\n",4,positive,"October 29, 2005",116 Gloucester Trail Muskoka,"('Port Severn',)",Ontario,L0K 1S0

Also, since this is a relatively small resort and rooms all have a separate outdoor entrance, the contacts are naturally reduced as compared to a large property with hundreds of guests, elevators, etc.\n\nThat said, the dining room tables felt a bit close and given that the room was never full while we were there, I think they could stand to remove a few tables to give some extra space, especially near the buffet table which tended to get backed up.

I suspect not enough thought has been put into how social distancing requirements will be managed and the guests suffer the consequences by being left standing outside, lining up for breakfast and lunch outdoors upwards of an hour in all kinds of weather. Only two staff members did guest plating at the breakfast and lunch buffets for the hundreds of people who had to be fed. In spite of the obvious inefficiency, no effort was made to make things run more smoothly \u2014 perhaps by offering plated table service or setting up another serving station.\nPeople were generally understanding but many of the staff were pointedly indifferent and that caused hard feelings. It costs nothing to apologize to guests for keeping them waiting and goes a long way to mitigating frustration.\n Phil, the dining room manager, was particularly inefficient and high-handed with guests, and it was frustrating to watch undertrained staff trying to figure out what to do. \nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s difficult to operate a lodge during these times, but graciousness costs nothing.

No big deal, they said the room was being extra carefully cleaned because of COVID.  We then went on to find an empty cigarette package under the dresser in the second bedroom so perhaps not fully cleaned after all...\n\nRoom very dated, plumbing barely functional, sorely in need of a significant renovation. \n\nLong waits (30 min to 1+hour) for breakfast and dinner despite showing up at the assigned time with two young kids.  Food quality subpar but edible.\n\nDespite their website stating high speed internet there is in fact 0 internet.  Again not an issue if one knows about it ahead of time, thankfully brought plenty of books for kids but the misrepresentation on the website bothers me.  Let guests know what to prepare for, don't lie.  \""Satellite TV\"" with five grainy channels a complete joke, perhaps the satellite is Sputnik....\n\nPart way into our stay we had a major power out, not an uncommon thing in cottage country so fair enough.  HUGE issue especially with COVID is that their water pumps run on electricity with no generator backup so now there is no running water or flush toilet anywhere on hotel property.  This goes on for several hours (I think about 5h)  Front desk not concerned, went to speak with a management type individual to inquire, he asked me if a bottle of water would help.  I declined....hard to flush a toilet with that or wash hands.  Was contemplating filling the recycling bin with lake water so I can refill the tank for the kids needs.\n\nOther than the first night dinner and first breakfast, we ate every subsequent meal off property.  The long wait and subpar food quality coupled with a clearly untrained wait staff was simply too much to settle for.  It is shameful to see how much the hotel charges and how little it delivers.  The amenities listed on the website are incorrect or perhaps deliberately misleading.  \n\nI do applaud the water ski staff for an excellent and enthusiastic job they did with the kids, I feel for the hard working wait staff who are not being supported the way they need to be.  Perhaps Severn Lodge needs to close for a while to get their act in order.

Unfortunately the restaurant only opens for one hour each day, 6.00 - 7.00pm, and you must book your sitting before 12.00 on that day!! Did you ever hear anything like it? It's a set menu so you get what is cooked. The resort shop does not sell any food, only hats and jumpers, and the nearest supermarket is 30 miles away.\nThis is only one example from a rotten resort, I'll not go on any further. I would have written a report on Tripadvisor earlier, but as no-one else had done so I did not want to advertise the place unnecessarily.\nAnyway the staff were unfriendly throughout our stay which ended early as I checked out and moved on to Niagra on the Lake. We weren't the only family to leave early as we met a family from Singapore who moved on after one night, I was stupid enough to wait four nights. \nBe warned that bugs and mosquitoes are everywhere in the Muskoka lakes in june and we could not leave our cabin afer 6.30pm as we got eaten alive, even with spray on.  Also I spoke to a guy in the next cabin who got charged one third the price I paid for the same facilities, a bit of a sickener when I had researched the whole thing as thoroughly as I could.\nDO NOT STAY at the Severn Lodge under any circumstances, it is a really awful resort with no customer awareness ( the staff are all students from Toronto concentrating on their own holidays for free accommodation) and the facilities absolute rubbish.\nThe Cottage barbecues are fixed so you can't use too much Gas (it takes an hour to cook a small burger), the restaurant only opens for an hour per day with a set menu that you must book 6 hours in advance, the shop only sells caps and jumpers - no food- the nearest supermarket is 30 miles away, the watersports are expensive, ants infesting the cottage, 1950 antique TVs in the cottage with only limited local channels, noisiest aircon ever, frequent powercuts etc. \nBy the way there are mountain bikes for hire, but no helmets or safety equipment. \nCheck out the review from the guy who used to work there, I couldn't agree more.

data/ca/1144943/568482/3741417.html,Severn Lodge,"""Unfortunately, little things have changed at Severn and we won't be back next year.  \nFirstly, the grounds are still gorgeous, the use of the lakefront is wonderful and the setting couldn't be more beautiful.  The accommodations are definately adequate, decent, clean, not fancy family style in both the lodge rooms and cabins.   One exception is that the beds are among the hardest and most uncomfortable ever.  We had mentioned this in our comment card last year but it was unbearable this year and a complaint I heard all over the resort.  Not much in the way of ammenities but this is cottage country so, it was adequate except the toilet paper, again a little thing but it was one ply scratchy see-through and if they use the excuse that they use that for the septic system most gals have to use an inordinate amount of that to do the job, so if you are going to Severn bring your own tp.  The tv got such poor reception and has no converter and you would lose channels but this wasn't a huge issue for us as we would only like watching news at bedtime etc. but the kids were disappointed.  We did have wireless service in the room and that was good, only faded a few times.\nThe food has changed this year and not for the better.  It's the same German chef so this was surprising.  I must say however that our one waitress Anika was delightful but the nights she wasn't there the service was terrible.  We saw two tables come in before us and they had their meals before we even saw an appetizer.  Except for the last two nights when we went into the dining room early to request that our white wine be chilled, the wonderful wine was served at room temperature and if you didn't want to add ice to your glass, it was a long wait for it chill in the bucket.  Since the children have a buffet every evening, they were always finished meal and dessert long before we ever saw an appetizer and this always makes for a bit of drama while the folks are trying to eat, you could hear unhappy kids \""waiting\"" all over  the dining room.\nBreakfast is really sub standard, nothing cooked to order, tasteless fruit this year (come'on, this is Ontario, we have wonderful fruit available, where did the \""brown\"" pineapple and bitter plums come from?).  Rubber eggs, all days scrambled except for one, on that day they looked over easy but ended up being rubber with crystalization on the solid yolks.  It was a real problem requesting toast to go with them and took about 20 minutes.  Only cream is served with coffee and we had to request each day that we receive milk for ours which seemed such a hassle to the staff.  With the fees, while this is a little thing, it's the little things that make the difference on vacation.\nSome of the meals for dinner were good (oh and the lunch burgers done outside were wonderful).  The presentation of the dinner was also nice but the quality has really gone down (except for the vegetables which were always wonderful).  It just wasn't nearly as good.\nUnfortunatley the staff were never around when you needed them, the boat fella was lazy and spent a lot of money on rentals (on par with other resorts) he actually spent about 10 minutes talking my kids into taking the kayaks instead of the paddle boats they wanted because he didn't want to have to put them in the water.  Activity staff was good for the really little kids but for older kids there is nothing and no contact with the staff at all.  \nWe won't be back at Severn and we are a group of 14, Grandparents, three sons and families (yearly reunion type thing) so our 15-16 thousand dollars will be going some place else next year.  Too bad as the golf in this area is great as are the riding stables (Rainbow Valley).  We aren't all that happy to please and may have nicely mentioned some of the shortfalls to management if we had ever seen any.  On the first meal we were introduced to the dining room manager but she almost ran away when anyone approached her, very unprofessional.  Again, it's sad because it could be a great resort if they put the typical Muskoka \""care\"" into anything, nobody seems to care about your stay and it shows.\nElizabeth Turner\n",2,negative,"August 6, 2005",116 Gloucester Trail Muskoka,"('Port Severn',)",Ontario,L0K 1S0

We ate breakfast at their restaurant (which wasn\u2019t cheap btw) and were served hard and cold pancakes and tasteless freezer home fries. And the cold pancakes were not even taken off the bill. Based on this experience we chose not to have any other meals at the Mill to avoid any disappointment but also can\u2019t comment on their lunch or dinner. However we would recommend family-run The Galley restaurant up the road for delicious fresh halibut and super friendly staff. \n3. If you book a Lake View room you may get a side lake view room or an obstructed lake view room so be prepared. We asked for a change and were somewhat accommodated.\n4. Even though the sauna is open until 11pm (and we were encouraged by front desk staff to try it at 10pm) it had not been heated and was cold.

It was the only cottage left open last minute (booked August 1st). Heather was amenable & kind in price. This was our first time to this resort and it didn't disappoint. Total R & R. The view from the dock was incredible. \uD83C\uDF05And, the beach area \uD83C\uDFCAwas clean and consisted of free canoes, kayaks (1 - 1 person and 1 - 2 person) along with three paddle boats and two rental 15' aluminum motor boats. There appeared to be 4 life jackets (one size fits all) in your cabin too. You could see the bottom of the lake that's how clean & clear it was. There is a boat launch for private boats 3 minutes away where you can launch and then tie off of the dock at Silver Eagle Cottages. Keep in mind it's not overly large but appeared it could handle maybe 3 private boats who cottages there. That's something I would suggest you speak to the resort about. The lake consisted of two connecting ones. Eagle Lake and Moose Lake! To get to Moose Lake takes some navigating as its shallow and a narrow channel. On the weekend as one would expect the lake can get busier with cottagers. The beach at the resort is private. Where you boat launch, has a public beach albeit it very small. \n\nThe communal fire pit was great. Met some fabulous couples and their respectful kids. We couldn't believe how respectful the kids and the families were. Very polite and friendly families. Most nights the fire started by whomever arrived first, at approx. 730pm and families with kids would come around 830pm and mostly be gone by 930pm. We were a couple who ended up every night by the fire with another couple and their two children laughing and joking until about 12am some nights while all the others vacated the fire pit area to their cabins around 930ish. We figured because the place was at capacity of approx. 75 ppl the fire pit would be busier. \uD83D\uDE33 nope! It was actually really nice. We had a great time every night by the fire. The resort supplied the wood. \n\nThe grounds were kept fairly good. We were told they maintain them on Sunday's between check out and check in as not to disturb people. Love it. Thoughtful, right! Who wants to be on vacay to hear property maintenance. \uD83D\uDE1DAnd, some nights Shaun (Property Mgr.) would come down to the fire and strum on his guitar. Him and Heather were friendly and fun! Which made the trip enjoyable and one of the the reasons for returning next year! \n\nThere are four cabins between our cottage and cottage 8 that were decommissioned and rightfully so. They really made the property look bad but not bad enough to not enjoy our time there. We did rebook for 2017 upon exiting. Only minor concerns we had and were mentioned to Heather for cottage 3 was 1. Bed was comfy albeit the bed slats that were holding the bed squeaked anytime you moved and could use either a board or something else under it to stop this noise as it woke us whenever my husband or I moved. So sleep was a bit of a problem. 2. Suggested cutting a bush down between cottage 3 and four (decommissioned cottage) so as to create room for the picnic table and eliminate bees and bugs. When we arrived the picnic table was placed between the two cottages and didn't feel right so we moved it out in front of the cottage which essentially blocked most of our pathway to & from the cottage. BBQ was located between 2 & 3 which was awkward but not a serious problem, just no room for both our table and BBQ. Cottage 2 had the same problem. They had to move there's to accommodate. Their picnic table was located next to our BBQ. Just lack of space that's all. And 3. Because we had full sun in the morning and afternoon (lunch) it was hot to eat either breakfast or lunch so we suggested an umbrella for this cottage picnic table. The bush was just that a bush and not a tree to supply shade. Now, As for the cottage itself, it was small and dated however Heather did well decorating. She appears to have an eye for decorating\uD83D\uDE09 had been fully stocked with kitchen utensils however no BBQ utensils luckily we brought our own. We found some dishes (coffee mugs\u002F wine glasses) were dirty so we had to clean them and leave them out of the cupboard because if I'm correct in the evidence we saw, there may have been mice around. It is a cottage. The deck has two Muskoka chairs with a partial view of the lake however once you sit in them on the deck you lose the partial view you have of the lake. The cottage is small and has two bedrooms. One with a queen bed, dresser and nightstand. Along with hooks on the wall and back of door. 2nd bdrm had a bunk bed with double bottom and single top. Top was pretty close to the ceiling. I couldn't imagine a child sleeping in it. Even one of the couples expressed concern of their child waking and smacking their head on the ceiling. And, it had a nightstand which really wasn't necessary. As it was awkwardly located and more in the way than anything. A shelf may have been more appropriate. Also, I'm glad they say to bring your own blanket because upon pulling the blanket on the spare bed that was there, to use as a cover for the futon (it appeared worn probably from kids sitting in their bathing suits\u002F furniture was worn from use) I found a hair tie after unfolding it and sitting on it and I know it wasn't mine! I did mention this Heather. We were able to view a few cottages via meeting people and noticed cottage #9, #1 were updated compared to 3. And, 11 was nice because you had a view of the lake and had the BBQ, Muskoka chairs and picnic table on the deck convenient. We didn't get to see other cottages however heard from others it was ok, it's a cottage. Some said they would've preferred another place down the road. I like the other place down the road however it didn't have the same pleasant, cottage ambience this place did. \""The place down the road\"" is an adults only resort and is ok for a night or two romantic getaway or either a place to have either a nice drink, lunch or dinner out. We loved the look, feel and ambiance better at the resort. Down the way at the \""place down the road\"" We did spa treatments - massage and dinner down there. Fabulous meal $55\u002Fpp three course meal\u002F pp. Fabulous. If you can steal a night away for dinner you should go. It had two seatings 6pm & 8pm. Casual dress. \n\nTown of Haliburton is 15 min away and has foodland and other common stores with a few nice family friendly restaurants. Also, on 118 approximately 10 minute drive, is a little coffee\u002F bakery. The Country Bakery. Good coffee & baked goods. Smells so good. They mentioned they may start doing prepared meals too! Check it out. I think it's right in line with Starbucks. \uD83D\uDE04\u2615\uFE0F\uD83C\uDF6A\n\nMinor things at Silver Eagle but nothing is perfect except that view from the dock\uD83C\uDF05If we had to suggest cottages, we suggest cottages #1, #9 and #11 (@ this time #11 only has a breakfast nook, no dining table unless you consider the picnic table on the deck which I would use anyways). Upper and lower lodge in my opinion are on a whole other level of cottage rental. Can't even compare it to the the cottages on the property. \n\nThere is a general store you can either walk to (10 min), drive (3 min) or canoe to and then walk over. Sells wine, spirits, beer along with general grocery items and a few prepared items. Reasonably priced too. \n\nWhen we were at the resort, Shaun and Heather did pizza on the BBQ night. $6\u002Fpp for a small personal size pizza (size of a dinner paper plate). They prep the ingredients including fresh dough and Shaun grills the dough and then, you top it and BBQ on your own BBQ. They BBQ down by the basketball court and then you go back to your cottage which is a minute walk from everything there. Pizza was delish too\uD83C\uDF55! Worth it\uD83D\uDE0B\n\nNice trails along hwy #35. Buttermilk falls and Log Chute trail which takes you to Trail Crest of Kannasis. \n\nWe love this resort for this 1. Reasonably priced cottage 2. Great free amenities 3. What an exceptional view from the docks\uD83C\uDF05 (especially for sitting and enjoying your fav bevie 4. Excellent & clean beach \uD83C\uDFCA\uD83D\uDEA3\u2600\uFE0F5. Fire pit 6. Last but not least Heather and Shaun really like what they do and work hard to carve out time to make you feel welcome. They were very forward and assisted us promptly with kindness whenever we found we needed something. For all these reasons we are going back 2017 albeit to rent cottage 1 and maybe bring others with us. All the other concerns are minor in comparison however should be noted as constructive criticism only tomake things more enjoyable because without concerns you can't go forward with improvements. You can't grow without them.

They even had a boat load of board games for evening entertainment or a rainy day!  Use of the kayaks and canoes were included which was awesome to get out and explore the lake.  Also fishing off the dock was a blast! Alot of rock bass which keep kids entertained for hours and the odd small mouth bass.  If you want to explore outside the resort theres lots to do very close by with the town of Haliburton with restaurants and shops or head to a wolf santuary just 20 minutes away.

There is a peacefulness and positive energy about the property that makes life seem incredible.  You get there and forget about all your worries and care. It is like life elsewhere doesn't exist as you soak in the gorgeous scenery, sit on the docks and take in the fresh, clean air and swim in the clear lake.  It truly doesn't get any better than this.  There is so much for the kids to do that they want to be outside all day.  The amenities are not only numerous, but included in the price of your rental, so once there, you don't have to spend any additional money- a rarity on vacation!  We have only vacationed at Silver Eagle in the summer, prior to this past weekend.  Spending Thanksgiving there was a wonderful decision. The beauty of the fall leaves changing, as well as feeling their crunch under our feel was incredible. The water level has lowered causing the beach to recede substantially. My children had so much fun finding rocks, shells, etc while walking on what is usually water covered.  The woodstove in our cottage (#11) was a huge hit with the kids and a wonderful bonus of cottaging in the fall.  Shaun even delivered us wood in addition to the supply we had when we arrived, because he saw we were using it often.  Talk about service!  In fact, that is one of the best parts of the resort.  The service is top notch.  Heather and Shaun, the couple who run the resort pay attention to every detail.  Our cottage had a fall live floral arrangement in it when we arrived!  The grounds are immaculate and everything is in great condition and working order.  Our kitchen was stocked with all the comforts of home.  When we needed an extra baking pan for our apple crisp making, Heather had one for us in minutes.  Silver Eagle cottages is a hidden gem in the Haliburton Highlands.

We have stayed here numerous times over the past 3 summers, in most of the cottages and have always left amazed by the experience.  This time though, we had the extreme privilege of staying in the just completed 9 bedroom lodge, which sleeps 20.  The place is in a league of its own.  Such attention to detail in design and furnishing leaves one wishing to never leave.  It has all of the amenities of home and then some.  The huge games room complete with foosball, pool table, chess table and 20 board games provided endless fun.  To top it off, it is on the second storey, has windows for walls on 3 sides, and has soundproof doors to the rest of the house. The teens stayed up late playing pool, but without keeping the rest of us up, and when the children awoke early they went in there enjoying themselves while the other's slept.  Fabulous!  Having a dishwasher and laundry facilities made for a trip with time just to relax and have fun, with no sand and laundry following us home.  We loved kayaking, basketball, paddle boats canoeing, badminton, sandcastle building, children's play structure, nightly campfires complete with comfortable benches to sit on and a lovely granite slab surrounded fire pit, making it safe for little ones wanting to roast s'mores.  All activities are complimentary, making it an affordable vacation.  Once there, there is no need to leave the property or spend money.  The lake water was surprisingly warm, crystal clean and weed and leech free, yes!!! The grounds are gorgeous with numerous flowers, large trees and even fairy gardens, to my daughter's sheer delight.  Much swimming was enjoyed by all. This review would not be complete without mentioning the staff. Heather and Shaun, the couple who run the resort are friendly, personable and are always around to help. I would set my garbage out in the morning and before I could get back out with my recycling, Heather had come along and changed it.

data/ca/12908465/671658/851592515.html,Sir Sam&#39;s Inn &amp; Spa,"""My husband and I decided to stay in Ontario this year and see what our Province has to offer.  What we learnt was that many resorts need to invest some money to bring them into the current year. I realize the past couple of years have been really tough and they all need time to recover before they can invest money but these resorts have not had updates in years. \n\nThere are many items to review at Sir Sam\u2019s.  Read just the summary or read through as I review each area: rooms, grounds, spa, restaurant. \n\nSummary\n\nFirst of all, there was a lot of good about Sir Sam\u2019s and we enjoyed our stay.  We are not really cottage people, but this is definitely cottage country, so keep that in mind as you read my review.  Everybody is going to have a unique experience and what is important to me, may not be important to you. I base my review on my expectations for the price I pay.  I am happy in a Motel 6 or the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills, I just have different expectations for each.  \n\nSir Sam\u2019s is a $300+ a night hotel and I expect a lot for that. Sir Sam\u2019s is old and really shows its age.  Our room was large, comfortable and clean but the furniture is old and worn, especially the balcony furniture. The restaurant is also old but the food is very good, just expensive.  Both dinner and breakfast menus are limited and would get tiresome after a few days. They use local where they can, even using Ontario distilleries and wineries. Double thumbs up for that. The grounds are lovely with amazing lake views and the use of Kayaks and canoes.  The pool looks inviting, although too cold to swim, even in July. The spa is awkward and not a relaxing space but the services are great.  My RMT was amazing. The WaterSpa was very nice and mostly functional.  The exercise room needs to go, equipment is too old and the room too small.  One of the best things about the place was definitely the staff, they were all amazing, helpful and friendly.  \n\nFollowing is a more detailed review:\n\nI feel if Sir Sam\u2019s invested in the right areas, it could be a top Ontario Spa and worth the price. This place has so much potential and I really wanted to love it.  When we first pulled in, we weren\u2019t quite sure we were in the right place, no big welcoming sign drew us in. We parked and looked for the main entrance.  There was no signage to the Check-in desk.  We walked past people eating on the deck and found the entrance.  The check-in desk is tucked under the stairs in a dark hallway and isn\u2019t all that welcoming, however, check-in was smooth and we were quickly in our room with bottled water and Keurig coffee pods. \n\nRoom\n\nWe had chosen room 6, their largest room with a large, screened balcony.  The room was large and comfortable and having the enclosed balcony was awesome.  Definitely recommend this room although the balcony furniture needs updating.  I think it has been there since the 80\u2019s. I spent many hours out here. The king bed is comfortable but the tv is too small for the room, however,  there is a lovely fireplace, with wood supplied.  Wasn\u2019t required in the middle of July but I am sure it would be nice on a cool night.  There is no air conditioning so it was warm in the room but we were grateful for the ceiling fan and the additional portable fan provided. I would have liked AC but since I think it would really only be required a handful of days in the summer, their money would be better spent elsewhere.  Perhaps in the bathroom.  The ancient, huge whirlpool tub belongs back in the 80\u2019s and the old countertops running over the top of the toilet needs to go.  We had an issue with the toilet running, and it is impossible to get the lid off to fix it.  Have no idea how the maintenance guys deal with this.  We were able to fix it by jiggling the handle a lot.  I would love to see the bathtubs torn out and replaced with large walk-in showers. At least the shower water pressure was good once I figured it out.  I also loved the comfortable bath robes (so much so that I purchased a couple). \nThe fridge and Keurig coffee maker were both appreciated, however, at this price point I do not expect plastic glasses and paper cups. (That is for Motel 6).  I had to beg the bartender to give me a wine glass and he only relented when I promised to return it within the hour. \n\nRestaurant\n\nWe had a bed and breakfast package and decided to have our anniversary dinner there.  The menu is very limited, but the food was very good, if expensive.  Our appetizers, main courses and desserts were all excellent and I really loved that they use local wherever possible including their wines and spirits.  I was thrilled to see vodka from Beatties in Alliston, my hometown.  They also had several wines from the Niagara region.  Breakfast menu is also limited, and I witnessed a Vegan customer having issues selecting something that she could eat.  She was going to be there for the entire week and didn\u2019t want oatmeal every morning.  The menu is basically your standard breakfast meat and eggs, omelets or hash bowls.  They bring a lovely pastry and fruit plate along with a fruit smoothie to start. Would be nice to see pancakes, waffles or French toast on the menu. Even as a daily special. We love eggs benedict but it is only available on select days. \nWe enjoyed the food but can\u2019t afford those prices on a daily basis and I think we would get tired of the menu after a couple of nights. If I had bought the breakfast and dinner menu, I would have enjoyed it and to be honest, there aren\u2019t many restaurants in the neighbourhood. \n\nSPA\n\nI visited the spa for a massage and this is another area I would love to see improved to make it feel more \u201Cspa-like\u201D.  This is supposed to be a Spa resort but the treatment rooms are in the hallway and again, no signage or direction as to where to go. My RMT therapist was amazing, so no complaints about the service itself. \nI also visited the WaterSpa.  Most of it was working and I enjoyed my time there. The fitness room, on the other hand, should just be closed!  The equipment is old and the room tiny and stuffy. I could not work out in there. \n\nThe Grounds\n\nThe hotel is on the lakefront and every room has a magnificent view. Our room overlooked the grounds, the pool and the lake.  It really is lovely.  The outdoor pool is not heated so was too cold to swim in but was nice to sit around and definitely looks inviting.  There are kayaks and canoes to borrow and they are happy to light a fire down at the beach at night.  We were really lucky to get an amazing sunset. Probably one of the best I have seen.  \n\nSTAFF\n\nZero complaints, the staff were all amazing and really made the stay pleasant.  Besides the wine glass issue, the staff were all friendly and helpful and really pulled together when a power outage turned the place upside down.  The power was out for hours and they managed to serve breakfast and remain upbeat and positive.  Kudos to them. \n \n Recommendations\n\nThese are just some thoughts as to how little it could take to make huge changes. Of course, spending a lot to update the resort would be awesome but probably unrealistic although I did read that they are working on updates.  Start with small changes. \n\nThere is so much wasted space in the main building and it is all cut up into weird living spaces.  I am sure they are used more in the winter but I never saw anybody use the multitude of hang out places, furnished with old sofas from the 70s and 80s.  They could take the first room on the left and turn it into a fabulous, inviting, comfortable lobby.  Have a side table with a pitcher of flavoured water available.  A small sitting area for weary guests to sit while their party checks in or while waiting their turn to check-in.  A simple office desk for checking in with a couple of chairs.  This would be a lovely inviting open, bright space and would get the staff out from under the stairs. Have a little retail area for the fabulous bath robes and a few toiletries and gift items.  E.G. fancy soaps and moisturizers, bug spray, even snacks and drinks. \n\nMoving further in towards the spa, install an etched window door to the spa hallway, with Sir Sam\u2019s Spa and WaterSpa etched on the door. This makes the Spa an actual space of its own.  The WaterSpa entry can also be through these doors.  The corridor to the left should have a sign saying \u201CGames Room\u201D.  \n\nAnd speaking of signs, a lovely sign at the parking lot with an arrow to the reception would be awesome. \n\nLastly, costing practically nothing, put china cups and wine glasses in the rooms, please, please, please. \n\nConclusion\n\nThis is probably the longest review I have done but Sir Sam\u2019s has a lot to offer and Ontario needs this kind of resort.  As indicated in the beginning, we are not really cottage people but if this is your thing and you want to relax in nature, you will love it here.  I personally was just a little disappointed but will keep my eye on their Facebook page to see the improvements they are making actually come to life.",4,positive,"August 2, 2022",1491 Sir Sam_s Rd.,"('Eagle Lake',)",Ontario,K0M 1M0

(even though this was not a focus of our stay, it was too small to be enjoyable to watch had we wanted to do so; the t.v. is over the fireplace and a t.v. that was the width of that area would have been a perfect size)\n-a larger ceiling fan or an additional small tabletop fan  would be great since there's no AC (thankfully it was cooler at night but, even with the balcony door open, the room was quite warm throughout the day and took some time to cool down at night)\n\nAmenities\nThere are many things one can choose to do if desired. There were sailboats, kayaks, canoes, paddleboards (and lifejackets). There were two tennis courts. There was a games room with a ping pong table and a bumper pool table. There was an outdoor pool (unheated) and a sandy beach area, both with loungers (and umbrellas on the pool deck). There was a boat cruise of the lake. There was a fire pit (and muskoka chairs there). There was also a spa and an indoor pool but we did not use those.\n\nRestaurant\nThe food was delicious and plentiful but we were happy we had the package that included breakfast and dinner as the prices were quite high and there are not many other options nearby. In addition to the regular menu items (which were fantastic), there was also a feature appetizer and entree each night at dinner. Most of the servers were lovely and we were impressed with this, especially since the restaurant likely had to try to staff on relatively short notice to pivot from patio to indoor dining. \n\nThis was a lovely, relaxing getaway.",4,positive,"July 22, 2021",1491 Sir Sam_s Rd.,"('Eagle Lake',)",Ontario,K0M 1M0

While the staff were really nice, I like and appreciate rustic and it worked in some parts of the Inn, rustic doesn't mean dated and tired, and that is what this place is.  Which I hate to say as I think it has so much potential and could be so great especially since they have the food part nailed.  And the location is awesome - right on Eagle Lake and a 5 minute walk to Sir Sam's for skiing.  It would be great any time of year because of that.  \n\nOur room was a good size and everything was clean.  Smelled a bit stale but my guess is that is the reality when there is carpet and a fireplace in the room.  Nice outdoor balcony which would be lovely in the summer.  The furnishings are really worn.  Not that it affected our stay but I would have expected better based on how it's advertised ('luxury') and the cost.  The bedding could be a bit more substantial, the duvet was really thin and the room was cool.  We used the extra blanket that was in the closet, and while I think it was clean it had burn marks presumably from the fireplace.  It's those little things that make an impression - that blanket should have been replaced.  The bathroom needed a total reno, it had a huge jacuzzi tub that was also your shower that looked like it was from the 80s.  The bathroom countertop was peeling, the sink fixture was rusted.  For some reason the heating also didn't work the last night we were there (unrelated to the power outage the night before) so we woke up again to a frigid room.  The room was really tired.  \n\nHaving a real fireplace in the room was a highlight, especially since there was a power outage on the coldest night of the year so far - definitely necessary!  Stocking the rooms with more than just two logs would be an easy thing to do to improve the experience.  Having matches, more kindling and paper at the ready in the room or easily accessible would have been great, it felt like we and the other guests were constantly asking staff how we could get more.  We read a review that said to bring a fire log and we were glad we did since it kept the fire going a lot longer the night of the outage.  And if you aren't skilled at making a fire it's probably a good idea.  The fireplace is small and shallow, and it is easy to smoke the place out if you don't know what you're doing.  \n\nThe highlight was definitely the food.  The Twin Fires restaurant had great staff and service, and everything was delicious.  They even managed to offer a limited breakfast the first morning while the power was still out - the benefits of gas stoves!  We appreciated that a lot because I'm sure it was a scramble to figure that out, and they were serving us in their winter coats!  The bar is cute, they have a really nice cocktail selection and we loved that they use almost all local products (Boshkung Beer, spirits from Beattie's in Alliston).  The bartender was a really nice young guy who was happy to give you a sample of the beer to see if you would like it or mix a cocktail of your choice.   It's too bad the bar area didn't have more activity, felt like every time we went down for a pre- or post-dinner cocktail we were the only ones there.  \n\nThe water spa was nice, but like the rest of the resort, dated.  All indoor.  Think of it like a really big indoor pool with jets in various places.  The sauna didn't fit more than 6 people so we didn't get a chance to use it as it was quite popular.  A real hot tub would have been great - it took us a long time to warm up after the outage!  We both had a treatment - massage and facial - those were both good.  \n\nThe staff were all friendly but there is a level of formality that was missing, that in our experience, is the norm in all hotels we have stayed even less expensive ones.  While we checked in, the person at reception was eating dinner at the desk and other staff members were there chatting with her and having some of her fries.  It was just a bit too casual.  Again, not a big deal but all of these things don't add up to Sir Sam's being a luxury resort.  \n\nWe appreciated that they refunded us the resort and an amenity fee without us even asking because the power was out for 10 hours.  We were shocked that they didn't have a generator to keep at least parts of the Inn functional during a power outage (especially when they have a huge pool!) but they were pretty resilient in rolling with it.  A bit more communication with the guests in that situation would have been good i.e. do you need a bucket of water for the toilet (while the plumbing wasn't working, there is a massive pool full of water that could be used), more wood, etc.  \n\nOverall this is a quaint little place that could use some TLC, and I would say is more 3 stars than 4.  Again, we didn't have a bad experience (yes the power outage sucked but that wasn't their fault), it just didn't match expectations and how the Inn is marketed.  \n\n",3,negative,"February 5, 2023",1491 Sir Sam_s Rd.,"('Eagle Lake',)",Ontario,K0M 1M0

We stayed in the main inn and had an extremely comfortable sleep. One thing to note is that this is an old building so if you are a light sleeper, I recommend bringing ear plugs and a white noise machine because you can hear people moving around in the hall and other rooms. The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub which I found very luxurious, despite it starting to show its age.\n\nThe dining room was small but comfortable and the wait staff was friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was just OK, but the dinner was incredible. I definitely recommend that you dine at the restaurant for dinner. Though it is a bit pricy, in my opinion, it is absolutely worth the price!\n\nWe really enjoyed the water spa. I would have preferred it if the pool was a bit warmer, however, it was still a nice relaxing soak. You will definitely want to moisturize after as the chemicals do really dry your skin out! My favourite part of the water spa was the deck fountains, and unfortunately one was not working.\n\nAs much as we loved our stay, I do think that there is a bit of room for improvement here, which could be solved by just investing a bit more time into maintenance and cleaning. As I mentioned one of the fountains in the water spa was not working, and we also had a chandelier in our room that didn't work, as well as the light in the closet that didn't work. There was a layer of dust on the baseboards in our bathroom, and we found a used tissue between the couch cushions. In the stairway leading from the rooms in the main inn down to the water spa, there was a lot of dust as well as some large dead moths that looked like they had been there for a while.\n\nAs I said, we had a wonderful time and will definitely return, but I think some more investment in cleaning and maintenance would make a huge difference.\n\n",4,positive,"March 20, 2023",1491 Sir Sam_s Rd.,"('Eagle Lake',)",Ontario,K0M 1M0

If you\u2019re looking for a resort next to a golf course, or something family-friendly, this is not the place to go. Also, if you\u2019re looking for a modern facility with all the latest amenities, this also may not be a great option.\n\nThe main lodge is over 100 years old and you definitely feel like you\u2019re in an old building. Fireplaces all over the place, smaller main rooms, and everything has a dated feel. Altogether it definitely gives you a rustic vibe like it was pulled out of another era (which it certainly was).\n\nWe stayed in Lakewinds 8, which is a large room in the main lodge (right over the lobby). It\u2019s close to everything, which is nice, but there\u2019s no balcony so it\u2019s really just a large, old hotel room. Jacuzzi tub looks like it hasn\u2019t been updated since the 90s, the bar fridge is definitely on its last legs, and the carpet is standard hotel-industrial. The furniture is older as well, but not in terrible shape. Good bed that\u2019s obviously the newest thing in the room. The biggest issue with the room is the fact that there\u2019s no AC. When it\u2019s hot (as it was for most of our stay) the room gets very uncomfortable. There\u2019s a ceiling fan and 2 large floor fans, but they don\u2019t help that much. This would probably be a nicer space outside of summer when you\u2019re less concerned about frying in your room. Also, the wi-fi is essentially non-existent. There\u2019s a free service but we were never able to get any devices connected to it.\n\nThat room was probably the weakest part of the whole experience. \n\nThe food in the dining room is fantastic and you will not be hungry on the meal plans. We had noted a gluten-free preference when we booked and they were well covered there - servers referenced it at each meal, and they had several special gluten-free items (and not the \u201Cscrape the croutons off and call it gluten-free\u201D cheats that many places try). They\u2019re currently not serving lunch but we didn\u2019t really miss it. You do have to book a time for dinner since their seating is somewhat limited currently, but it all worked out well. Service was great with friendly, attentive staff and plenty of nice extras at each meal. \n\nThe waterfront amenities were plentiful, and functional. We never needed to wait for a canoe or kayak and there were ample life jackets and paddles for all sizes. Also plenty of lounge chairs and seating in different places, so you never need to stress about claiming a lounge early in the day. I also noticed that the staff were very scarce during the day - they were at the main desk if you needed something but outside of that they pretty much leave everyone alone. The free boat tour of the lake was also a welcome and pleasant experience.\n\nOverall, we liked it and it\u2019s highly likely that we\u2019ll be back.

Both of us really enjoyed them.  Despite not being a registered massage therapist, she was really good, and was able to find extra spots that needed attention.\nWhat stood out was the condition of the carpets and walls.  There were stains along the carpets in the hallways and in our room, with burn marks and holes.  The walls were quite bashed up as well.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, but quite cold on our arrival.  Keeping in mind that the resort, at this time (due to COVID) was only open on the weekends, we are guessing that they would have had the heat turned down during the week.  However, it would have been more welcoming and comfortable if the heat had been turned up in anticipation of our arrival...and they were aware we were coming as we had booked approximately a month in advance.  The hallways were also quite cold.\nOnce we were settled into our rooms we headed down to the \""Water Spa\"" so we could enjoy the relaxation of the different water features.  However, we were disappointed to discover that the temperature of the water in the pool and in the pool area was too cool to really relax and enjoy the jets.  Unfortunately this did not improve over the weekend.  We had read this comment in previous reviews and were dismayed to discover it had not been addressed.\nWe were also unable to enjoy a nice fire in our room, not because we aren't able to start a fire, but because all of the wood on the property was rotten.  The other couple had the same, and when we asked to start a fire at the beautiful outdoor firepit after a walk,  we were provided with matches, but told we had to put it out.  No one offered to light it, and all the wood alongside the firepit was also rotten. So after the 4 of us tried to get the fire lit using some dry wood from the trees as kindling, we gave up.\nFinally, we were also subjected to a Resort Amenity Fee, which we were aware of, and didn't mind paying, until we discovered that we didn't really get anything out of it.

The front desk called when the room was ready. COVID protocols taken seriously. Free parking and a bit of a struggle to bring luggage upstairs (Inn room). Rooms were nicely updated and comfortable (nice bed, bedding, new flooring and wallpaper). Not a fan of the big step in tub\u002Fshower combo and tiny TV.  The mini-fridge kept things very cold. Coffee and Keurig maker included. No air conditioning which made the room warm during the day but comfortable at night due to temp drop and lake breeze and the ceiling fan. Small peaceful sand + pebble beach front but no chair pads or umbrellas for shade. Great, free boat ride on Eagle Lake. Breakfast made to order to stay or go was excellent. Just pay gratuity. Porch dining available for dinner. No lunch served. The outdoor pool was unheated, on the cold side and could be better kept. The pool should be cleaned a few times a day given the surrounding trees and debris. Umbrellas went flying and no one put them back and secured the stands (or better yet, fixed them) since they are wobbly. No side tables. No one to clean chair pads or to put them away when it rains. No fresh towels available at the pool. This would make a huge difference along with replacing or repairing the cracked cement around the pool. Some repairs underway.

It is an historic Inn originally built as a private hunting lodge in the early 1900\u2019s and still has that original character.  \n\nThe public spaces are comfortable - the bar area has couches by the fire and a pool table.

The resort is well laid out, and the perfect size to feel like you are getting away from it all.   We loved that it was adults only.   The beach was nice, with sufficient kayaks, paddle boards, and canoes to get out on the lake.  The hotel operates a small boat called the Lady Hughes which they use to run daily tours of the lake - highly recommend this free activity while you are there.\nAnother favorite feature was the fire pit.  The perfect space to sit at night to watch the sunset and listen to the loons.   There were always a few people sitting by the fire and it was nice to chat with everyone.  With less than 60 people at the resort you quickly get to know the other guests.\n\nThe main inn is over 100 years old, and like the inn the whole property is showing it's age.  We stayed in room 34 which was in the lakeside building, not the main inn.  The room was comfortable enough with a small balcony and a couple of nice wing back chairs in front of the wood burning fireplace.  The beds and pillows need to be replaced, and the carpet should be replaced with vinyl flooring as its impossible to keep clean with guests coming in from the lake, the surrounding woodland, or the ski hill.   While we weren't there to watch TV, the one in the room was ancient and too small to watch (maybe 20\"").   \n\nThere was a small fridge but it froze everything that we put in it, and the room did not have a microwave.  The Kuerig was a nice modern touch.  \n\nWe opted for the breakfast included option since the closest town is about 30 minutes away.  Not sure if it is because of the covid restrictions and lower occupancy but service for breakfast was slow - taking on average about an hour from arrival to completion.  There was a standard menu, with a \""chef's choice\"" that changed daily.   It also included a \""continental tray\"" which included 2 shot glass size smoothies, a single pastry cut into 2 or 4, a single ramekin of fruit, and another ramekin of yogurt with granola.   While we laughed at the small shared portions, it was sufficient because of the size of the main breakfast plate.   Menus are available on their website for both  Breakfast and Dinner.   We decided not to do the optional included dinner since the menu is very limited (only 5 or 6 entrees) and we were there for 6 nights so it would have been very repetitive.  \n\nThe outdoor pool was never used, by anyone, the whole week we were there.  It would be a good investment for the hotel to update this pool with a heater as many people complained that even the lake was warmer than the pool.    There is an indoor pool\u002Fwater spa which is heated to about 85 and has different jets and water features, which was lovely.   There were also very comfy bali beds at the indoor pool, and comfortable loungers on the beach by the lake.  \n\nOverall I think with a few updates this resort could be the luxury resort it claims to be, but in its current state it is a little over priced, but worth the visit.",3,negative,"September 9, 2020",1491 Sir Sam_s Rd.,"('Eagle Lake',)",Ontario,K0M 1M0

The management needs to reevaluate cleaning staff. There were handprints all over our mirror, fire place area looked like a hunting camp. Carpet heavily stained and needs to be replaced ASAP. Heavy smell in room. Black fingerprints on all doors and walls. The furniture is rickety and poor quality. Black smoke damage on walls and ceiling near fireplace. The ceiling fan was ready for take off and kept us up all night, as well as our friends in the room above us. They thought someone was pounding on our door. Rooms need to be refurbished, repainted and brightened up. We know this is a rustic resort, but it needs some very serious love and some money put into making it aesthetically pleasing as well as hygienic. It deserves this!!! Patio furniture broken, mismatched and old. Overall for what the rate is per night 3\u002F10. Come on owner, invest in some changes! \n\nLack of lighting outside on of the rooms resulted in one of our friends being injured and could have ended up way worse. Management did rectify but bad lighting should never be an issue. \n\nThe bed was extremely comfortable and linens were good quality. \n\nWater spa was very relaxing. That environment needs some plants and it would have been great to open the sliding doors to get fresh air and easier access. We didn\u2019t try the outdoor pool as it isn\u2019t heated. \n\nThe outdoor grounds need more natural landscaping and care. As a natural environment it could be way more beautiful. \n\nThe food was completely amazing there were about 10 of us and we were all very satisfied. The billing at the end of every meal was a bit much and should be an automatic process as we had everything included in our stay. Everything should have just been forwarded to the room automatically. \n\nThe waterfront is lovely and the fall colours   were gorgeous. We took a complementary boat ride with captain Kevin, and he was fantastic. Probably one of the highlights of our 2 night stay. There are also nice hikes and walks in the immediate area. \n\nOverall it was a nice getaway especially during these times, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019d be back unless the owner puts some love back into what was once a really amazing historic property.",2,negative,"October 4, 2020",1491 Sir Sam_s Rd.,"('Eagle Lake',)",Ontario,K0M 1M0

The workout equipment was not only cheap but also worn out.  The belt slipped on the treadmill, the elliptical was wobbly and ready to fall apart and the exercise bike was noisy.  This is the kind of equipment you would expect at a garage sale not at a luxury spa.  We went to Sir Sams about 15 years ago and found the indoor pool\u002Fspa area much more spa like.  There was relaxing spa music playing in the background and you could enjoy all the various stations around the pool to relax.  Not so this time.  A number of the features at the indoor spa\u002Findoor pool were not working, the buttons to activate the various pools features were popping out of the floor, the once clean and inviting loungers looked dirty, and there was no music.  I happened to see a long haired gentleman, I assumed was the manager and asked him why there was no music playing at the spa.  He casually and dismissively said the music was knocked out during the last storm.  That was it. No indication as to when the problem would be fixed.  Seems kind of strange that something so simple, that could be remedied by even a simple cheap CD player won\u2019t be addressed.  I got the same dismissive attitude from the front desk person when I told her that we could not connect to the Wi-Fi in our room. She said: oh yeah the Internet around here is really bad.  Our stay at Sir Sam\u2019s did not start off well either, when we got to our room we had no towels and the toilet was dirty.

The unit is in dire need of updating but the most surprising part was the absolute lack of cleanliness. The unit was absolutely filthy, bathroom floors, window sills had not been cleaned in some time, the carpet was so dirty that no one should walk around bare foot, walls and baseboards were in need of paint but a good cleaning would help to make things somewhat acceptable. This resort is noted as a luxury resort but unfortunately those days are over, to access the Northwoods building you must drive behind the main inn and you would think you are in a back alley in the city with th debris and garbage laying about. When the front desk staff was approached with our concerns they basically stated that covid 19 was the issue, a late opening halted their cleaning schedule ( not sure why that affected cleaning) and they were well aware of the deficiencie.....so why not fix them...because they are fully booked and have a wait list we were told!!! To have your resort booked is no excuse for a lack of cleaning and care and if these guest receive the same lack of care with the accommodation and service they won't be back. We have come to this Inn many times over the last 20years but unfortunately this will be our last visit. The new menu for the season is not particularly pleasing and the various dishes we sampled were basic at best, some very lacking in flavor,  not even close to the reputation of wonderful dining that used to exist here.

The hot water pool and Jets however did not get opened as apparently the inspector cancelled which was disappointing. We had hoped one of the 5 days we were there this might happen. The Wait staff seem to try hard to be pleasant although there is an air of frustration with some which is noticeable however there were a few that were amazing. Food quality has slipped since they brought in a new Chef from a few years back. Steak we ordered arrived cold after waiting over an hour. I ordered medium well done yet came very very rare (very pink and cold) The salmon we ordered on another evening also was really under cooked as well as the broccoli which almost tasted raw. Returning the plate and waiting another hour for a new order was just not an option when you are starving you eat what you can. If you have any allergies especially if you are gluten free do not expect any choice of desserts aside from a bowl of fruit, so I would recommend you bring your own desserts.  No attempt was made to give a number of gluten-free alternatives of which there are many! When I approached Steven the manager about this he blamed the waitresses for not telling the cook to make steak well done and sorbet and fruit was good enough in his opinion for the gluten free people. In years past I had amazing Carrot Cake (best I ever tasted), butter tarts etc all gluten free.  The regular dessert list is amazing but no real desserts or any effort made to make anything special for gluten free folk. Breakfast was fairly good although some things offered on the menu were not available like the black beans in the Ranchero Eggs which both my sisters said made the dish. Again if you ordered an omelette well done it came soft and undercooked. I had brought my own coffee but both my sisters did not like the coffee offered..too bitter. I would say there is a very definite decline in the food. With this new Chef and also with a very non caring attitude of management.

We were booked for a 2 night stay and left after one. \n\nOur stay was during the power outage mentioned in other reviews. My partner and I are very understanding and certainly recognize they had little control over that aspect of things but the communication was so terrible it was impossible to enjoy our stay. \n\nMultiple calls to reception went unanswered resulting in having to gear up and walk outside only to find 2-3 staff members standing around chatting with no guests in site. The reception staff were unprofessional and unhelpful. Unable to answer questions, giving incorrect information and fumbling on small requests. \n\nThe power outage resulted in our room having no hot water even after power was restored and many hours beyond that; we were not notified\u002Fnot given any option of moving or even an alternative area to shower and prepare for dinner. The maintenance person was working very hard and was very nice but repeatedly entered our room without pausing after a short knock with the last time occurring while I was changing.  \n\nThe one meal we did have was very good and the servers in the restaurant were excellent. \n\nThe rooms were okay, bed was comfortable and linens were adequate. Fire wood and supplies were lacking, even while the power was out. Fixtures are old and there was significant old water damage in our washroom with signs of mildew and mold. \n\nWater spa is dated but was enjoyable. \n\nWe were compensated for the night we did not stay and some of the inconveniences and concerns noted above but in my opinion not adequately.

Since this was the first week of September, there were not many guests, but that didn't matter since we just all seemed to want to quietly take in all that was offered here. A bonus is the proximity to Haliburton, which has so many great little galleries and diners,we went back twice to see everything.

Our goal was simple rest and relaxation away from our typically busy, hectic lives. We had a wonderful time thanks to the way Bill and Heather run this little gem of a resort. Bill builds a ~200ft toboggan run each winter and we had a blast on it. What's nice is that because the resort is small we had it to ourselves each day we went. The cabin we stayed in was very warm and cozy, well furnished and with lots of essentials included. They have a movie wall where you can borrow any number of kids' and regular movies which we enjoyed in the evenings. On Saturday night we wanted to get some ice cream so I called Heather to find out whether a store would be open in the area. She gave me the name of a place but also offered some that she had in her freezer if we weren't able to get any; ultimately I was able to buy some from a store but the fact that she offered some shows how much they care about their guests' experience.

We will definitely not be returning there, even though we love the town and area and plan to make more trips to cottage country. So it's the proprietors' loss of solid repeat business.\n\nThe major let down of the trip was our accomodations at the Loralea Resort in Minden, Ontario. We feel a bit duped and dissapointed by the cottage we booked.\n\nWhatever you do, do NOT stay at the Loralea resort. \n-----\n\nThe photos of the cabin online showed a brick fireplace, wood paneled cabin, promoting a secluded setting by a lake. We got there at 11pm Friday to discover a dingy little shack, with orange shag carpeting, reeking of old cigarette smoke, which was part of a big campsite with lots of other cabins around. The owner made us pay upfront before seeing the cabin. At that point we had no where else to stay (after a 2.5 hour drive) so we stayed the weekend and made the most of it.\n\nGet this...the \""brick fireplace\"" shown in the resort website photos was fake. There were no bricks. There was a fireplace, but with this cheap, fake brick vinyl wall paper around the mantle. The wood paneling? Not real wood! It was particle board or plastic siding with fake wood-print  on top!!! The stupid place was built on a hill, so the floor had a lean. And a big puddle formed in the bathroom every time you took a shower and wouldnt evaporate. Even the tea kettle didnt work, and the owners didnt bring us a new one when we asked for one. The double bed was also tiny with thin, worn blankets and sheets! \n\nThere were two little threadbare brown mangy towels left for us for the whole weekend. The proprieters were really rude and acted incredulous when we asked for more towels, finally handing over extras begrudgingly. And they yelled at us for letting the dog run off leash. \n\nWe got a general feeling of unwelcome from the owners. They never asked us how we were doing. We left a day early and they never asked \""how was your stay?\"" or \""is there anything we could have done better?\"" Just general poor service and attitude.\n\nOverall, a beautiful setting on Halls Lake. We woke up early on Sunday to watch a magnificent sunrise. \n\nOur trip was still great DESPITE this resort. My boyfriend and I went on a day trip to Dorset and hike up their Watch Tower to see a great view of Haliburton's fall colour glory, lakes, forests and streams. \nWe also visited the remarkable and unique Scupture Forest beside the Haliburton School for the Arts and Fleming College.",1,negative,"September 19, 2005",17560 Hwy 35,"('Halls Lake',)",Ontario,K0M 1J2

Quite different, as it\u2019s very spread out, rather than a big central building. It gives a feeling of not being busy, when I\u2019m sure there are plenty of guests around. There are lots of staff with golf buggies willing to give you a ride, instead of walking, which is good as it is hilly. The rooms are really nice, we had a family suite, which was a really good size, with lovely views. The dinner options are really good, but compared with eating in local places is very expensive by comparison. The worst value of all is probably The Ranch steak restaurant, which is $50+ for a steak with no sides, which seems so out of kilter with Thailand costs. Breakfast is very good, loads of choice and the kids really liked the buffet. The reef snorkelling was close during our visit for maintenance, which was disappointing. The swimming pool is nice, but feels like some maintenance is needed, lots of missing tiles. By the pool, again the cocktails are quite expensive in comparison with outside the hotel. Overall it\u2019s a good hotel and costs probably quite typical of a high end hotel, just feels like it\u2019s like you are paying so above local rates it feels expensive for the location.

The location of the hotel is nothing short of breathtaking, with two small private beaches and an 80m infinity pool looking over the sea. \n\nIt's hard to leave the hotel, but it is well located if you do like to explore - a short journey from Chaweng beach, Cheongmon and Fisherman's Village for bigger beaches, shops and restaurants. \n\nThe staff who work in the hotel went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. Chris was always checking on us and helping us whenever we needed - he provided a warm and friendly service and always with a smile. Raven \u002F Gam and the other restaurant staff couldn't do enough to help. Jak and Popcorn around the pool made us feel well looked after, and Bobby was the best driver providing an entertaining journey for our kids every single time. \n\nThe rooms were spotlessly clean and there were daily gifts such as banana candies, dried fruit, macarons and coconut candy. \n\nThe restaurants are all superb - Pak Thai is one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in. The pool restaurant and room service also served us well. Cocktails at the pool and also at the bar (served by super friendly staff), were a daily highlight. \n\nMy only two niggles would be the price of the spa, it was very expensive, but there are plenty of places to get a massage nearby. And also the fact the ocean pool is closed due to storms. Neither of these things impacted the quality of our stay and we loved every minute of our time.\n\nThe place is wonderful and we would come back in a heartbeat. Our teenage sons had a great time too. None of us wanted to leave. \n\nA heartfelt thank you to everybody there for giving us such wonderful memories and for making us feel special every day for the past 14 days.

A couple of weeks prior to our visit, I had an engaging conversation with Mi from the Resort Concierge. Her expertise and invaluable suggestions helped me plan an array of activities in Koh Samui, ranging from an unforgettable Elephant Safari to exhilarating Scuba Diving, rejuvenating SPA treatments, and indulgent dinners. Our experience extended beyond the confines of the hotel, as we explored the wonders of the island.\n\nThe hospitality of the staff was truly exceptional, and their warm demeanor made us feel right at home. Notably, my daughter struck up an endearing friendship with two members of the staff, Eve and Ellie, at the Ritz kids club. She had such a fantastic time at the kids club that we had to regretfully cancel our fishing activities. The joy on her face was priceless.\n\nOur time at the Ritz-Carlton Koh Samui was truly remarkable, creating memories that will be cherished for a lifetime. We are already eagerly looking forward to our next visit, where we plan to bring the entire family along for another incredible experience.",5,positive,2 weeks ago,9\u002F123 Moo 5 Plai Laem Beach Koh Samui,"('',)",Surat Thani Province,84320
data/ca/1179396/12504573/913217137.html,"The Ritz-Carlton, Koh Samui","""Firstly I have to mention the staff - they make this hotel what it is. Mi, Jake and Ae in particular were absolutely amazing and couldn't have been more helpful, but ALL the staff were excellent - always helpful, friendly and professional and as the grounds are very large, they have a 24 hour buggy service which you can call on and the staff are always driving by and offering a ride, which is actually really fun and helpful.  And secondly, I have to say we had a genuinely fantastic 2 weeks there and loved the hotel and our holiday, even if there are a couple of things to improve.  \n\nSome things clearly are 5 star and deserve note:\n\nThe breakfast is served in a spacious and immaculate area and caters for all tastes.  The food is always fresh, plentiful and delicious - possibly one of the best hotel breakfasts we've ever had.  \n\nOur room was also fantastic - the space was huge; the bathroom had all you could want and was spacious, the wardrobe space and hangers were very good, the balcony area was nice (although wooden clothes racks outside are a little stupid as they leave marks on the clothes when they are wet and it's wet clothes that get put on them).  Nice coffee machine, mini bar\u002Ffridge, brilliant aircon, comfy bed, plenty of storage etc....overall we LOVED the room.\n\nMy wife also tried the spa and said it was incredible (I'll take her word for it, but the pictures looked amazing), we also tried the mini golf which was fun and I went out on the kayak a couple of times and my wife used the paddle board, all good.  The gym is nice and open 24\u002F7 and there are other things they don't promote, they have a Muay Tai ring (and do lessons for free), a pool table, table tennis, and even though it's quite far away, they have basketball court tennis courts.\n\nThe restaurants are all good, but expensive.  The street food on a Saturday is excellent and possibly the best of the lot, although Pak Tai is as good, but more intimate.   The beach BBQ had amazing food and a fire show (but it finished at 8, so get there early) and it only goes ahead if there is no rain, but like all tropical climates that sometimes happens at night, so it often gets cancelled.  This brings me on to the things that could (and should with little effort) be improved....\n\nSome things less than 5 star:\n\nThe beach - it's not great.  It's actually small pebbles, which are uncomfortable and there are rocks all over one side (in and out of the sea) and an outlet pipe, and the other side with the paddle board etc. is still pebbles and has 2 outlet pipes (why these are there I have no idea, but I suggest they move them ASAP).  Improve this and get some sunbeds and parasols on the beach and this would be much better than it is now.\n\nThe pool needs some work.  It's a nice size, there is a little pool bar and you can get drinks and tasty food and they constantly bring round small refreshing shots of lychee juice and cold water, there are always fresh towels and enough parasols and sunbeds - we spent a lot of time there and honestly really enjoyed it, but...the actual pool has some tiles missing (kids pull them off) and the repairs are less than excellent and it could use some care.  It wouldn't take much, but needs work.\n\nAnd lastly, they don't use their assets well.  The beach BBQ area is in an amazing location, but used at most once a week, the same with a huge central area that they hold the street food market night at. And they have lots of things going on around the pool they don't promote.  They really need an app that informs you daily and invites to things of interest.\n\nDespite the above, it's a very good hotel, with amazing staff, great rooms and some very good facilities and food.  I do recommend it as we had so much fun.\n\nSome tips:\n\nChaweng is not that pretty, lots of tacky bars, I'd only go there for shopping or to go into the hills and go to the Jungle Club - a very stylish bar with fantastic food and an amazing view over the whole bay (definitely worth a visit)\n\nFishermans village is not as good as it used to be, but is still worth a visit.  For food try 'The Thai Tapas'. It is possibly the best restaurant in Samui - authentic Thai food with a hint of French and by far and away the best staff and service in the area, possibly the island.  For drinks, try Coco tams  - nice to sit on the beach on bean bags and have cocktails (most cocktails on Samui though don't seem to have any alcohol anymore sadly).\n\nThe best beach in the east is probably Lamai.  It's sandy, clean, warm sea and has some nice places to eat and drink.\n\nThe best restaurant close to the hotel if you want good food and to watch the sunset is Sea La Vie.  The service is not bad, the food is good and the view is great.  Avoid The Sunset Restaurant  - average food, very poor service and a lot of noise when planes land.\n\nUse local taxis, not the ones from hotel.  They are cheaper and reliable.  Most trips of a reasonable distance should cost 400 Thai Bahts and don't accept the first price they offer on the way back - always haggle as they will attempt to push it up, but they are honest and will honour any 'deal' you make.  If it was 400 there, it should be 400 back.\n\nMy Samui island tours are amazing - there is one that goes around the national park of islands and is well worth doing for a day.\n\n",4,positive,"August 27, 2023",9\u002F123 Moo 5 Plai Laem Beach Koh Samui,"('',)",Surat Thani Province,84320

Breakfasts are amazing, the restaurants, beach barbecues and food are all fantastic and there's so much variety to allow you to have different dining experiences all week, plus entertainment like fire juggling, Thai dancing and live music. We also love the large pool where mango and lychee slushee shots get brought out every hour. If you bring a full face mask, the hotel's natural reef pool is also great for a swim - at least, once you get over the sense of stepping on algae. At first it looks like there's not that many fish in it, but then once you're in, they'll all come and find you! This sense of swimming with dozens of fish in the artificial reef is really wonderful, especially since the actual sea - though warm and gentle - is a bit cloudy in August and shoals of fish were quite hard to find.\n\nAnother tip if you plan to visit is to look for the sandy beach to the right of the main hotel beach. You can walk to it in seconds from the far right of the hotel swimming pool, but you may not spot it immediately. The Monday night beach barbecue (not the Wednesday one) is there and as well as being totally secluded - while still very much part of the hotel - the sand is way softer than the shelly sand on the main hotel beach.\n\nWe really did have a wonderful time. My only real regret (and I know this sounds spoiled) was not getting a view, or a plunge pool, which wouldn't have felt so noticeable if my father-in-law hadn't got both! We both snapped up our rooms in the BA sale, taking what was available in the same deal, but he ended up with what looked like a honeymoon suite from a movie whereas our room, while spacious inside, didn't have any kind of view other than grass and other rooms. It did feel a bit like we were in the 'family flats' rather than getting the full incredible Ritz Carlton bedroom experience, but I guess you get that when you have a very large hotel?",5,positive,"August 20, 2023",9\u002F123 Moo 5 Plai Laem Beach Koh Samui,"('',)",Surat Thani Province,84320

As a Titanium Elite with Marriott Bonvoy, I have experienced a myriad of Marriott hotels around the world, and the level of service I encountered here is a standout.\n\nPrimarily, I would like to commend the exceptional work of Mr. Chaiwat Henry Billahteh, the Assistant Front Office Manager. Mr. Billahteh's commitment to improving the hotel experience was simply beyond any standard I've previously seen. He did not just passively manage his tasks, he was proactive, displaying a real passion for change. His dedication reflected in quick resolutions to all our issues, usually within 5-10 minutes. He personally oversaw significant improvements in the hotel, such as the achieved significant enhancement of Wi-Fi connectivity and fitness center facilities. Moreover, his attention to guests was unparalleled, knowing us by name from the get-go, and always being incredibly attentive.\n\nDeserving of praise is Gettypansanton (Bobby). As one of the buggy drivers, Bobby's politeness, friendliness, and advanced English skills greatly contributed to our stay. His assistance was especially valuable when we suffered a jellyfish sting at the hotel's beach. His actions throughout our stay proved him to be a truly caring and efficient professional.\n\nLastly, I want to mention Roman from the food department. Originally serving breakfasts, he later moved to in-room dining. Roman\u2019s courteousness, care, and love for his work were simply admirable. His service was a testament to the great training that staff at Ritz-Carlton receive.\n\nIn conclusion, our experience at the Ritz-Carlton Koh Samui was largely defined by the attentive, dedicated staff that truly sets this hotel apart. I can confidently say that the quality of service here is unparalleled.

So spacious and beautifully appointed. \n\nBreakfast selection is vast and the pool is lovely. \n\nHOWEVER - It really is a sprawling location. Very spread out so you will have zero independence. You need to call for a buggy to get anywhere from your room. Eg breakfast, pool etc.  the distances between these locations is too far to walk in this heat. \n\nThe location is in the middle of nowhere. You can\u2019t just step out of the hotel into the neighbourhood. You have to call a cab. They have a shuttle to Chaweng but only three times a day. \n\nThe beach is beautiful to look at from the pool but you cannot swim in the sea off the uncomfortable gravelly beach as there are sharp rocks under the water.  This was really disappointing and had I known this we would not have stayed here.  There are loads of beach bars now around this part of Koh Samui where you can step straight onto fine golden sand and swim in the sea. This is NOT that. \n\nYou can borrow a kayak ( free between 12-1pm) and that was fun. \n\nService is good. They try hard but it\u2019s not as effortless or slick as other places where we have stayed. It feels a bit like they are constantly trying to upsell you to their dining options and tours. \n\nA bit of a shame really as it ticks all the boxes on paper but I wouldn\u2019t come back here as you feel a bit of a prisoner in a luxury encampment ( I realise how ridiculous that sounds) .  \n\nIf however you are looking for somewhere to drop a load of cash and not be disturbed by other people - it\u2019s probably ideal.",4,positive,2 weeks ago,9\u002F123 Moo 5 Plai Laem Beach Koh Samui,"('',)",Surat Thani Province,84320

I didn't follow up. But luckily my hubby picked up the ball and booked us in for a couple-y three day get -away at the beginning of January 2016 to celebrate my birthday.\n\nIf I were to summarize what I look for when I decide to stay at a place, I would say that these criteria are (in no particular order) all very important to me.\n\n-Activities\u002FAttractions\n-Hosts\n-Food\n-Location\n-Rooms\n\nAnd in all of these categories, the Fern Glen Inn B&B was exceptional.\n\nActivities:\nWhen we were there, we experienced a new activity each day. The first day we borrowed the complimentary snow shoes and had a short hike through the wintery wonderland behind the B&B. The next day we drove to Arrowhead Park (25 minute drive in the snow) and rented some cross country skies and skied for a few hours in the park. Then on the third day, Brad took us dog sledding which was full of fun and adventure and no where near as relaxing as one would think (in a good way)!!\n\nHosts:\nJackie and Jim were a pleasure. Totally engaged and committed to making our experience perfect. Jackie is so talented in the kitchen. She would make us a two course breakfast each morning and two course dinner every night. One of my favourites from her kitchen, were the Rhubarb muffins, fluffy as clouds, filled with Rhubarb from the garden and covered with crunchy sunflower seeds and just a dash of cinnamon sugar. I would drive back 4 hours up north just for those. They also took the time to chat and tell us their stories about what it takes to live in the great white north and what inspired them to move in the first place. I really liked that they took the time to make time for us. Also Jackie regularly called and followed up regarding our dog sledding tour, coordinating all the contact that needed to be made so that we could make the dog sledding tour a reality. I really appreciated her for that. Thank you Jackie.\n\nFood:\nWell, I did already mentioned the two course breakfast and dinners but really the food was just a culinary delight. Did I mention the homemade chili with homemade corn bread? The perfect dinner to warm you right up and make everything in the world right. Think ground beef, perfectly seasoned and with delicious additions such as celery (not too soft, not too hard), kale (not too mushy), and mushrooms. Delicious. And coupled with a slice of corn bread, with a perfectly golden exterior and crunchy top served right out of a hot cast iron skillet. Then there was the fruit parfaits, pancakes with blueberry compote... need I say more?\n\nLocation:\nAlso perfect. In the middle of nowhere, but not completely. A 30 minute drive to Huntsville and you were back to civilization, well sort of, but you get what I mean. Then there was beautiful Arrowhead Park near by and Algonquin too! The drive was also not too deadly. With just a 3-4 hour drive from Toronto, you don't feel demolished after the trip up. \n\nRooms:\nPerfectly decorated. Our room had this antique-y feel like it was an old's grannie's room from the 60's or 70's but in a good way! And let me tell you why! It let you disconnect. You didn't walk into a room with a tv on your wall, you walked in a perfectly clean and tidy room with all the comforts of home from a big bed to a hair dryer to plenty of closet space. It also had a beautiful ensuite bathroom with a claw-foot tub. The Green Room, where we stayed, was literally, and I mean literally, a stone's throw from the place where lunch and breakfast were served. So although you are technically in another house, you can run across for breakfast without a jacket, even on a snowy night. And I couldn't talk about the rooms, without mentioning the Coop. Although it never was a chicken coop, the Coop is a little cabin behind the two buildings where the guests are accommodated. This little cabin is fantastic! Walking in, is a blast to the past in the best possible way. This small hut is filled with boardgames and a playing table, books, an old radio, a small fridge, o-so-comfy sofas (a recliner!) from the 70's and best of all, a wood burning stove. This little cabin really drove home the point to my husband and I, how sacred it is to have a place containing very little technology...i.e. NO Wifi! We actually discussed the possibility of recreating our very own little coop as an extension behind the garage. As soon as you entered this place, it brought back the vital importance of reconnecting and interacting through games and chatting with mobile phones and iPads outside of the picture. It was an important realization.\n\nAnyway, if you are going to go somewhere, up North, just go there.

The Old Man and the Sea, the resort restaurant is fantastic, with wonderful seating on a private beach overlooking a picturesque cove. The food is quite good, with the clams and lamb shank being my personal favorites. The room was basically a bamboo hut with an outdoor washroom, which was very charming and makes you feel like you're glamping on a tropical island. Service was prompt and friendly - shoutout to Rocky, Wendle, Ryan, Saldy, and Mary (sorry for incorrect spelling) for the fantastic service. We rented a car and spent most of the day exploring the island. When we returned, we were greeted with lovely accommodations. Would definitely recommend.

The villas are spectacular, the food both gorgeous and delicious, the views to die for but what makes AOV special is the incredibly dedicated and loving staff that made us feel like family the minute we stepped onto the property.  Maria and Mary took care of everything from calling cabs to COVID testing, Ryan with his sweet manners became a son to us, Zaldy's smile greeted us every morning at breakfast, Wendel served us dinner in the private cabana and even SERENADED us (I am choking up thinking about it--it was that beautiful!), Soledad's custom cocktails kept us coming back to the bar (ask for the passionfruit!!) and Rocky our host was the most gracious ambassador for this special and unique property. He even brought us homemade johnnycakes at our last breakfast!  While we love Aruba and have enjoyed different properties on the island nothing compares to what we just experienced at the Villas. We never left the property because we were so content and relaxed--sunbathing and swimming during the day and watching the stars and passing cruise ships at night.  No detail has been overlooked at Isla Alistaire.  The furniture and decor is elegant without being fussy.  There were so many places to lounge and enjoy the beautiful views. We were incredibly comfortable in the air-conditioned bedroom and on the expansive outdoor patio.  The restaurant on the property (Old Man and the Sea) is outstanding; breakfast (included in your stay) was hot and different every day, great lunch menu (ceviche YUM) but make sure you book one of their tables for dinner for the most romantic, intimate experience ever. Rocky had the chef make a special lobster dinner on our last night as a surprise--I was so touched!\n\nWe are so overwhelmed by this wonderful family of people and the property they serve and are planning a return trip next year.

Since the resort only has 8 villas we decided to stay in 3 of them. All of them were unique and beautiful but Isla Allistaire was so amazing we wish we didn\u2019t have to leave. Waking up to ocean views every morning and having a private deck and water entrance was once in a lifetime. Joy was so great helping us plan every step of the way and Wendel, Zaldy, Maria, and the rest of the staff were so amazing. They truly made us feel like family when we were there and since it was such a small resort we really got to know the other guests as well and had some great nights eating and dancing on the beach. We didn\u2019t have a bad meal and really got to be one with nature. We did plan a number of excursions since we weren\u2019t really walking distance to much but it was just the right balance.

I pride myself on researching and finding some of the best vacation experiences and this place did not disappoint. I am so glad we found the Aruba Ocean Villas. It completely lived up to the photos online and then some. We came for our 5 year anniversary and it was also our first trip just my husband and I since having kids. It was the perfect amount of romance and relaxation we needed. We stayed in Orquidea which was stunning with it's open aired bathroom and how it opened right onto the beach with gorgeous views of the ocean. On the flip side, you do have to check your privacy a bit at the door given that opens up right onto the shared beach area and the restaurant is right next door, but it honestly was never an issue with the strategically placed foliage and you could close the curtains if you needed. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay special. We got to know many of them by name and enjoyed conversations with them as well as other guests at the beach side Tiki Bar. I also can't say enough good things about the food or drinks here. We never had a bad meal. Breakfast is included and changes everyday and is wonderful and fresh. We had lunch here several times and we had dinner one night in the overwater table villa that is reserved for hotel guests only. It was gorgeous right at sunset and so romantic. We both got the Lobster and Shrimp a la Vodka and we are still talking about it!

We stayed at the villa named \""Joy\"" for the first two nights, and then we moved to \""Orquidea\"" for the remainder of our stay. Do take a look at each offered villa, as they do differ quite a bit in accommodations. \n\nI strongly encourage anyone interested in staying at these villas to do thorough research and understand that you will not have the same experience that you'd have staying at a hotel or resort. When we first arrived, this realization hit us a little hard. You will have to learn to deal with sand, bugs, and outdoor plumbing (at least in our experience). There are also lizards or geckos that can be noisy in the night. They make a sort-of chirping sound, and they will probably be in your roof. Once we came to terms with this, and decided to consider it a form of \""glamping,\"" we greatly enjoyed our stay. \n\nThe whole staff at AOV works their hardest to make sure you have the best experience. Several nights we found ourselves sitting at the bar when the restaurant was closing just to chat with Zaldy, Rocky, and the rest of the staff. Zaldy was also such a pleasure for the (included) breakfast. He made it easy to enjoy a delicious breakfast on the beach each morning. \n\nThe villas are a perfect representation of this part of Aruba. It is very much away from the hustle and bustle of the more touristy areas of the island, and AOV is true to that. My fianc\u00E9e and I rented a car so that we could experience the more touristy parts, too, but we found ourselves relieved to return to our tranquil villa at the end of the day. We even carved out some more low-key days at the end of our stay to make sure to enjoy it to its fullest. We personally enjoyed having the company of the cute and friendly resident cats and dogs, too.

Not only does the man care for your every need and ensures your stay is properly attended to but he also plays music, serenades the guests, as well as, keeps the drinks flowing. Marialisa, from the time you walk through their doors, keeps your every wish top of mind. She went as far as testing the bathtub temperatures herself to ensure everything was just right. Jeddah had such a lovely spirit and Zaidy had a smile that always kept you in a good mood. Enough can not be said about the people there  who keep you constantly in a state of relaxation. Settling in to your room is an experience unto itself. Great care has gone in to the decor and the island feel you're enveloped in as soon as you walk in to your bungalow. No two bungalows are the same and so you feel a unique sense of personalization during your visit. As if everything there was meant just for you. It's a quiet, intimate, and romantic escape but they provide just enough entertainment and activities to keep you exploring. Their glass island was a exciting and surprising add to our whole experience. It's important to keep in mind that aruba, as a whole, is a small island. So things like consistent water temperature are a constant challenge. During our stay, renovations were being made and so construction was underway. At times, it was a distraction but knowing this in advance, their whole team stepped up to accommodate. We really appreciated all the hard work that went in to keeping us comfortable and happy during our stay. Saying,  we can't wait to visit again, would be a gross understatement.

My boyfriend and I went for a much needed vacation, to start we waited 1-2 hours for the rental car company to come get us from the airport. While waiting a guy walks over, we assume he is the rental car guy, no sign no id, nothing but a raggedy blue jeep; we head to the rental place once again assuming, this is the transport vehicle. hahah nope this raggedy, dirty jeep wrangler is ours for 5 days wow.. this is NOT what we reserved... after calling and asking, of course all the jeep rentals are booked (JOY where is the phone call or text you alert your guest prior to arrival to advise that this what NOT the vehicle reserved). So after accepting this horrible jeep, we are off to Aruba Ocean Villas, I hope you have GPS because there are no signs alerting you of the property once again Aruba alot of assumptions. We arrive in the hot heat to find out, the room is not ready of course, for the price of these villas, check-in should be a breeze.

We drop the bags, to find out the toilet does work ... like really what else could wrong... ha  you wont believe.... I will say this is a nice location off the beaten path, if you want the remote vibes.... But somethings that needs attention: breakfast is daily, fresh but how are you to contact the front about the time of service, each day we had to REMIND them to bring breakfast? a walkie talkie or sometime of communication system is needed.. we are here to relax not walk back and forth to the front desk asking for breakfast.... the AC ... suggest the roll around ones, ceiling fan, or lower the units, it was extremely hot in the villa, the air blows but to the ceiling (unless you remove the bed canopy covering). Towards the end of the vacation the power on the entire islands goes out, no generators? and no one alerted us of this ... we found out by arriving to a dark resort ..then they locked us out of the resort after we had to sleep in the car because the villa was just was to uncomfortable; the lack of communication is horrible, this is where joy shouldve alerted us, oh we we had to tell her... smh ... I do recommend dinner AMAZING, the chef she out does herself she needs her own location,  I had the surf and turf one night and the salmon with the fresh veggies.... a meal must.... the bar staff was amazing .. they were very accommodating. This is a very pricey vacation and for this the service and communication should be top notch (hire me for a few months)... Massage was amazing that we did it twice (highly recommend) more activities are needed, perhaps a meet and greet, a cocktail hour, trivia night, I get the intimate approach but who always wants to be in a hot room.

We actually met the owners while there and said the villas are named after their grandchildren. The staff, the grounds, the views & over experience was everything we could have asked for. The weather is perfect, little to no bugs, can snorkel right out of your villa (equipment in your room). In our villa there are two beds. One that is outside with amazing an amazing breeze and can watch the sun set while taking an afternoon nap. The other is in your room which is a canopy bed. It has a white sheet around it (like a screen) you close at night (for the very little bugs they have) and they have a unique system that pumps A\u002FC into just the bed area. Super awesome! For bathrooms there are no doors but was located in the villa where you have privacy. The shower is also in the open but has shades you can drape for privacy. There is no \""all you can eat\"" options. Breakfast is included. Eggs, fruit, toast, meats, juices, oatmeal and more. The property is spotless. They are adding several more villas so at times you may hear some construction but it is not overwhelming at all. The construction is being added to the left of you and there is another villa between you and construction so we found it not to be an issue whatsoever. There are no TV's & WIFI was pretty good. We brought a speaker and played our own music. Pandora doesn't work outside of the US but Sirius XM does so if you have it download the app before leaving.

But we love all the things nature gives us so we LOVE this place and cannot wait to come back.  \n\nFirst off, the transportation Joy set up for us at the airport was great.  The driver was there waiting for us with a sign displaying our name.  The ride to AOV is short and comfortable and he was friendly and informative.\nThe parking lot at the entrance of the hotel does not look nice. They are doing construction for an addition (more about that later).  I did not see any sign with the hotel name (maybe that's intentional!).  But once you walk through those big wooden doors into the massive number of flowers, plants and trees you get the idea and the peace of the place sets in.  \nThis walkway leads to both the lobby and the beach.  Check in took maybe 5 minutes.  The staff introduced themselves by name.  Mike the bartender gave us each a delicious drink and Mary walked us to our villa, LouLou.  She took a few minutes to show us the workings of our place.  \nThen the vacation began.  \nThe place is beautiful.  Smaller than I imagined and that is not a bad thing.  9 villas on property and 1 house a bit up the street.  A small beach with chairs, beds, hammocks.  One restaurant has beach seating at several tables.   One bar with a few stools.  \nThe staff really is amazing.  The AOV staff is there for anything you might need (goggles for snorkeling, alerting you when rental car comes, setting up Covid test, etc).  The staff for the restaurant Old Man and the Sea , is the staff that takes care of you most of the day.  Mentioned before, Mike the bartender, is awesome.  We loved talking with him.  He is full of island history and was really cool to talk to.  He works very hard.  Makes the drinks for the waiters while taking care of those sitting at the bar.  He has hardly a spare moment.  Daniella is very kind and hard working. One day we sat and visited with her for quite some time while she worked setting things up for the evening rush.   Zalvy has the sweetest smile and serves with kindness.  He served us at both the beach tables and the table at our room. \nWendal is professional and does his job with pride.  He also plays the guitar and sings!!!  He is very good at it.  He says its his hobby and during slow times loves to play for the guests.  We sat at the bar one night with he and Mike and we sang, danced and gave song requests.  was one of the finest nights.  Dexter is the manager (I think).  He's a funny guy and walked around to see if there was any needs not being met.  Dexter took us on a tour of the addition being built.  A new lobby, a new restaurant and bar and 3 garden villas coming in.  The progress looks amazing.  Should be open soon. He also took us to tour the house, Sunset Villa, which is up the street and can accommodate several couples or a big family.  It's pretty awesome too! There are a couple other employees but these are the ones that served us during our 5 day stay.\nI hope every guest who comes here tips generously.  Excellent service. \n \nYou can eat at the beach tables or ask for your food to be brought to your room. \n Breakfast is included and not only is it delicious but its a lot of food.  Plenty to eat.  \nWe only ate lunch twice (usually too full from breakfast!) and the lunch menu is great.  Food delicious.  The dinner menu, WOW.  The food is excellent.  Wine selection great.  Everything is so good!  Perfect combination between the staff, the food, the atmosphere.  It's incredible!  I can't say enough about it.\n\nOur room was incredible.  Pictures cant really capture it all.  All the decorations, furniture, the outdoor shower- it's perfect.  very chic.  The foliage, the water, everything is incredible.  The bed was very comfortable.  Fresh ice water every day.  \nThe room did have a small fridge with some drinks, coffee and tea.  before your room is cleaned they come find you to get the key.  All the villas look amazing.  Of course the penthouses are the best.  But if we get the blessing of coming back we will stay in the LouLou again.  It was just perfect for us!  Oh, and since you can not flush TP there is a bidet.  Never used one before but we are getting one for our house now!\n\nDaisy the dog lives on site.  She is Adoreable.  Well behaved.  From time to time she barks and I like that!  Reminded me of home.  She never begged for food.  But during dinner she was around sometimes laying in the sand close to tables.  The staff seems to take great care of her.  \n\nWe got a couples massage one day.  We never had a massage  before but figured well it's our 25 year anniversary so lets do it !  I have no point of reference but I can say WOW.  This too was awesome.  And the area of the resort where the massage cabana is, it's beautiful.  Nature at it's finest!  All the sounds of wind, birds, water, light music put me at ease. I was a bit nervous but the therapist are very professional and made me very comfortable.  Everyone should get a massage and I hope tip them generously as well !  \n\nSnorkeling was awesome here.  There is a reef literally right there.  We spent couple hours each day snorkeling and swimming.  My husband loved the paddle board.  He spent alot of time on that as well.\n\nWe left the resort one day and rented a car to tour the island.  We were heading back by 6pm because we just wanted to be out of the city and enjoying the peace here.  \nThe resort is also in walking distance to two restaurants-Zeerovers and the Flying Fishbone.  We really wanted to try Zeerovers as we heard thats a local favorite but the day we walked up there (Monday) it was closed.  \n\nIf there was any suggestion I would offer it would be to have a booklet of some kind giving the history of the place and why each villa is named what it is.  We were told our villa was named after the owner's granddaughter.  But there are so many personal touches to AOV that it would be nice to have in print (or on line) information about this place.

If you are looking for a secluded place, that is a perfect tropical paradise, this would be for you. The small beach is pristine, with lots of comfy chairs and beds to relax in. The drinks were great. The breakfast was included and was overall okay - our first morning definitely had the best breakfast but they switched it up day to day. We also ate dinner 2 nights which was also very expensive, but very good. The first 3 nights we stayed at Chupi and I loved it. Please be aware there will be tons of mosquitoes and lizards around as there is a lot of plant life. The only complaint at Chupi was that the electricity kept going out from time to time and we woke up at 6 am one day sweating as it had gone out in the night. Chupi was magical though and I loved it. For the last two nights the only place that was available was Sunset Villa, which was silly for 2 of us but the deck was huge and right on the water and that was incredible. Overall we felt that while Sunset Villa was great, it definitely was way more run down than the main property - lots of peeling paint, overgrown shrubs etc that need some attention. We were expecting as nice as Chupi and it just wasn't quite it. If you're going with a group of 8 though, Sunset Villa is a great deal and you would have a ton of fun. I loved that there were no kids and it was so quiet. The staff was good and was attentive to our needs.

We originally booked Aruba Ocean Villas for a Fall trip in 2020, however, COVID had other plans for us. The travel concierge, Joy, kept in constant contact with us to help re-book our stay. We stayed 5 nights in villa Isla Alistaire. As soon as we entered the property, the staff took over and the relaxation began. The check-in process started with a staff member asking what we'd like to drink. Less than 5 minutes later, we were checked in and told to leave our luggage to be delivered to the villa. With daquiris in hand, we were escorted to our villa. We were in awe of villa Isla Alistaire. The villa was beautifully decorated and we were super excited for what the next 5 days had in store for us. Over the next few days, it became obvious how much pride the workers have in the property. The beach was constantly being raked and maintained and staff members were always checking in to see if there was anything we needed. One minor inconvenience we encountered was a weak wifi connection from our villa. We mentioned the weak signal to the front desk and they gave us a hot-spot to take to our villa. We were surfing the web in no time! Joy even went out of her way to stop by our villa and ask if we'd like a tour of the property. She showed us all the different villas and showed us the progress being made to build a few more over-water villas. Every now and then, we could hear a faint saw cutting wood as a result of the expansion, but the noise was very minimal. The beauty of Aruba Ocean Villas is how secluded and intimate it is. The villas are each designed for 2 adults, so when they sell out the 8 villas on property, there are only 16 people in total. This was our 5th time to Aruba, we usually stay in the crowded and energetic high-rise area. Aruba Ocean Villas was the complete opposite, we really felt like we were the only people on the island. I spent most of the time floating in the ocean with a beer in hand alongside our villa while my fianc\u00E9 floated in the plunge pool attached to Isla Alistaire. Any requests we had were promptly addressed. The toilet and shower took a little getting used to. Since the property has its own water treatment, they ask that you don't flush toilet paper. As a result, the toilet is equipped with a bidet. That sucker can really wake you up! The outdoor shower definitely adds some island life to the villa. Unfortunately, the shower doesn't put out very hot water, it's not cold, but its not hot. Which really wasn't a big issue for us. One thing we wish we knew beforehand was to have bug spray applied at all times. We never saw mosquitos, but they left their mark several times. Aruba Ocean Villas provides every villa with bug spray, be sure to use it. In conclusion, my fianc\u00E9 and I highly recommend Aruba Ocean Villas to any couple looking escape reality, while enjoying top-notch service. We will definitely be back! Huge thank you to Joy and the entire team for a vacation we will never forget!",5,positive,"December 7, 2021",Savaneta 356-A,"('Savaneta',)",,

These are fairly rare on our side of the world, so we decided that Aruba Ocean Villas was our place. I read every review including the negative ones before booking. We chose Orcheidia based on it's location in the resort and I am SO glad we did. I think it may be the only villa directly on the beach. From start to finish, this was a gorgeous adventure of a stay like none other we've had. Yes, the furnishings are rustic. Yes, there are a few manageable mosquitos. Yes, I even had a few moments with figuring out the hot water. Yes, I saw a lizard or two outside, and a peacock showed up on our bathroom roof one morning (I paid extra for that). Channilla and the entire staff were on every single request we had via Whats App, which was very convenient. The view was stunning. The amenities are ample. Both bars are beautiful. The Old Man\u002FSea restaurant was delicious, and the service was top notch. The resort pets (2-3) were just precious! Breakfast service and food was just off the charts incredible. I've seen all I need to see of Aruba, but I would go back just to stay here. Pros: NOT in all that hotel crowd on the North side of Aruba (I seriously could've been in Florida or SC with that vibe), private, same lot as the Flying Fishbone which was amazing, excellent and conscientious staff, beautiful grounds and facilities, I mentioned the \""pets\"" like the pup and two kitties, and the very personalized service! Cons: they wouldn't allow for late checkout because more happy people were coming in. :)  A few tips: take advantage of the breakfast service to your room, get their tips for your villa on how the hot water works best, apply a little bug lotion to your ankles\u002Ffeet each morning, rent a car and explore the whole island, make reservations at the OMATS restaurant early (you CAN ask for the special seating on the covered dock, but that certainly isn't necessary), walk the property and see the whole cool place, and lastly, enjoy the uniqueness of this property. The property is not well marked from the road, and the parking lot for the whole block of surrounding properties is not paved, but once you walk in the resort, lovely. The need to not flush TP is not exclusive to AOV as we ran into this a few times across the island. Just need to respect the goal...

We got married in Aruba and wanted a couple days at the end of the trip for just my husband and I. I came across the villas on TikTok and after doing some research I knew it was prefect for our honeymoon. \n\nFirst and foremost, the PROPERTY was GORGEOUS. Little accent furniture and decor really made your heart happy. It is a beautiful island escape with a jungle feel. All the little details do not go unnoticed on this property, absolutely stunning.\n\nWe stayed in the Penthouse Mai Wisha. DISCLAIMER we were supposed to stay in the Dushi Sue, but they were renovating the deck and it wasn't complete on our arrival (of note, we did walk by that villa and the new deck looks gorgeous). We were upgraded to the Mai Wisha and it brought tears to my eyes. \n\nThe Mai Wisha is a beautiful villa equipt with a pool (which was filtered ocean water),  stone tub, outdoor bed, bar area, outdoor and indoor shower, and 39...yes, 39 places to sit. It was breathtakingly beautiful. There was air conditioning just above the bed which was all you really needed and we stayed cool all night. I really can't describe this villa in words but it was truly a dream.\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea restaurant is on property and we had a reservation there on the first night (on the over water bungalow table). Daniella, our waiter, was the kindest woman- she made it just a great experience. The food and atmosphere was perfect. The second night opted to have dinner on our villa and again, phenomenal food. The complementary breakfast also blew us away, delicious! \n\nThe great thing about the resort is they heavily use \""WhatsApp\"" to communicate. They were always a text away. We would text them our food orders and anything we needed delivered to the villa and they would drop it off no problem. It was such a great tool. \n\nChanilla & Angie at the front desk were absolutely lovely! Such kind women who we hope to meet again some day! Very professional! Swinda also checked us in, and although we didn't have a ton of communication with her she was so sweet and kind as well. The staff at the resort in general... ALL LOVELY! Such a genuine staff, we loved them all!\n\nBeing on the resort property, there are villas that do not have super private decks but are beautiful.

We stayed at Aruba Ocean Villas the last 3 nights, as this was all the availability allowed. It was our honeymoon and we wanted the bungalow in the water, which we got Dushi Sue. We were very excited about the villas, however it wasn\u2019t what we expected. We got to explore the island and see all the clearwater beaches Aruba bad to offer.

data/ca/1158886/12915710/909480379.html,Aruba Ocean Villas,"""I was fully expecting to absolutely love this tiny resort based on IG posts, reviews, website photos, and initial interactions with Joy. Unfortunately, this did not turn out to be the case, and I\u2019m hopeful that this thorough review will save other travelers a great deal of disappointment. \n\nSome background: I rented the Sunset Villa (now called Owners Estate) and Elle Marie for my husband and I and eight friends. We were celebrating my birthday and spent about $10k total for four nights. I called before I booked on the resort\u2019s own website and confirmed a few details including that breakfast was included. I also asked about air conditioning in the Sunset Villa and was told that while there was a\u002Fc in the bedrooms, the common areas would be cooled with ocean breezes and fans. This seemed ok for us. \n\nUpon arrival, the sunset villa, where our eight guests would stay, was steamy. There was one fan in the living room but this was the extent of the cooling. No breeze at all - just an overwhelming standing heat in the living space, kitchen, etc. The deck is incredibly beautiful and functional, but be prepared for heat in the house should you book this villa. Cooking was absolutely miserable. Just so, so hot. \n\nUpon check in for the smaller villa, I was told that the larger sunset villa did not include breakfast. We would be charged the regular price of $15 per person for this. I pushed back since the website did show that \u201CAll villas include complementary breakfast.\u201D (The website has changed since we were there, and now sunset villa is called \u201Cowners estate.\u201D) I was told that \u201Cbecause the Sunset Villa is an Airbnb, breakfast would not be included\u201D and was encouraged to speak to a manager the next day. \n\nI did not book an Airbnb. I booked two villas on this resort\u2019s website. At no point did anyone mention that this villa was not treated as part of the resort. It\u2019s listed with every other villa on the resort\u2019s website and books just the same. \n\nShirley, the manager on duty, would hear none of it, even when shown the website on my phone, and continued to repeat that \u201CIt\u2019s clear on the website that the sunset villa does not include breakfast.\u201D She offered \u201Ca special rate of $15 instead of $20\u201D for my trouble. Little did she know that her front desk had already told me that $15 was the regular rate. I didn\u2019t argue, but the way this was handled was very petty particularly considering what we\u2019d spent to stay. \n\nWe canceled my birthday dinner reservation at this restaurant and went elsewhere due to the bad taste this left in my mouth. When I mentioned this to Shirley, she said \u201Cthat\u2019s fine. We sell out every night anyway.\u201D They do not, in fact, sell out every night. I can confirm this because we walked through several times each evening coming back and forth between the villas and it was always very quiet if not completely empty. \n\nThe grounds are indeed beautiful. Elle Marie villa was really cute, had great a\u002Fc, and a good bed. However, the bathroom was outdoors. We knew this going in and actually looked forward to the charm, so this would never have been a problem except for the mosquito problem.  \n\nSO. MANY. MOSQUITOS. \n\nI went home with no less than 100 bites. Thankfully, I had worn pants and brought a sweatshirt on the flight, so I suited up every time I had to go to the bathroom just to avoid more bites. The mosquitos swarm the toilet due to the standing water, I assume, and it was 100% miserable to be there, even with bug spray. We resorted to my sweet husband fanning me with a hand towel to try to keep mosquitos away every time I had to use the toilet. So ridiculous. \n\nThe charming outdoor areas were unusable for us due to the swarms of mosquitoes that immediately began biting anytime we stepped out. Clouds of them around the tub and sitting areas. We didn\u2019t see anyone using any of the outdoor spaces, actually, including the beach, likely due to the pests. \n\nThere are also some privacy issues with Elle Marie, though, that one might want to be aware of before booking. The door to the villa is right at the restaurant, and there is a only a sheer white curtain covering it. (See photo) At night, we could see straight to the bed from the restaurant if a light in the room was on. There are also cracks in the bamboo fencing around the outdoor bathroom, so we could see and hear conversations of the people walking by while showering. I\u2019m sure that was true in reverse, as well. \n\nThere was also some frustration on the day we checked out. The ten of us were the only people at breakfast but it took a full 90 minutes to get our food. A two hour breakfast meant that we were not going to be back to the big villa to pack up and get out by the 11am deadline, so when I texted the front desk to request another hour to check out due to the loooong delay at breakfast, I was told \u201Cno, sorry. We need for you to be out by 11.\u201D \n\nImpossible. We were still sitting at breakfast finally eating at 10:45, having arrived at 9. Eventually at 10:50, after I told them that we simply would not be out by 11, they relented, but at this point, it was too late to change it with our transportation folks and they left us when no one came out of the house by 11. Just a total comedy of errors. We made it work, but not because it was made easy for us by the folks running the resort. \n\nHaving said all of that, the employees here are absolutely lovely. Jada at breakfast is a star. The people working on the grounds are so kind and warm. The bartender is wonderful. \n\nBut management really needs a lesson in communication and customer service. They could really have something special if they were able to master the art of addressing issues with grace and a sense of understanding. \n\nSo while this was definitely not the luxury we had hoped for, our friends were good sports. Suffice it to say that we will not be back, regret selecting this property, and wish we\u2019d spent my birthday at one of Aruba\u2019s real gems.",2,negative,"August 11, 2023",Savaneta 356-A,"('Savaneta',)",,

We then returned in June this year for a 3 night stay and we had our wedding here which was just perfect. \n\nSunset villa - I stayed here with 5 of the girls from my bridal party. The villa is off the main property a walk of around 3-4 mins. Upon entrance to the villa we were totally wowed with how fabulous it is. The views on the decking are spectacular and to watch the sunset from here was perfect. The villa is very spacious and is equipped with everything you could need. It was great to have a dip in the beautiful ocean which is access directly from the decking of the property down a ladder. Floats were provided too if needed. The master bedroom was unreal with full glass doors looking out to the ocean and to top it off there is a door to the garden where there is an outside bath! The whole experience was fabulous. There is a super friendly lady who resides just off property (her name escapes me) but she was so helpful and friendly, got us coffee the next morning and helped us to get the coffee machine going. \n\nIsla Alistaire - My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights and it is without a doubt, the most amazing place we have ever stayed. There is a beautiful 4 poster bed in the room with a very unique mosaic bath in the bedroom with taps made from shells - it was stunning! The bathroom is an outside bathroom and was a fab experience to shower outside (it's still private enough). The decking area again was just unreal - an outside bed, outside bath, seating area, direct access into the ocean and its own swimming pool with fountain and hammock. The villa has a fridge which was stocked with refreshments and also has a coffee machine and a table to eat outside if you wish to eat in the privacy of your villa. The breakfast that is provided is great and there is a huge selection available served right on the beach. My husband won the 2 night stay through a Facebook competition and Joy allowed us to postpone due to covid and also let us use the stay for the night of our wedding. It was such an unforgettable experience! We will be returning in 2023 for another stay in heaven! \n\nWe fell in love with Aruba Ocean Villas (AOV) back in 2019 during our first visit so we decided to have our wedding here. AOV is a very intimate, peaceful setting so suitable for small weddings rather than huge weddings I would say. Didi, Oxana and their colleagues planned our wedding from start to finish and I cannot say enough how fantastic these ladies were. They took care of everything and every little detail was perfect! All of the staff at AOV were just the best, they were always smiling and couldn't do enough for us. The wedding itself could't have been anymore perfect. All of our guests loved the venue and the atmosphere. The food was great - cooked to perfection. I can't thank the team here enough for giving us an unforgettable, perfect day. I lost my Grandad in July 2021 and Oxana and Didi even arranged for his photo to be in our room at the end of the night - it's these small, special touches that mean so much. \n\nIf you are thinking of staying here 100% do it!!

It almost feels like you're stepping into a private world with a personal chef and butler -- the resort is so small that the staff gets to know you by name. My spouse and I didn't feel like \""guests\""; we felt like well-cared-for friends. The resort is exactly as pictured online. I have a unique sense of taste, so I was drawn in by the decor,  the colors, the pillows, the greenery, the beach, and the sheer beauty of the environment. OMG, the outdoor showers are everything!!\nYou feel exotic and sexy, not primitive. The food and cocktails were outstanding, with great selections and ample portions. We were treated like royalty by Wendell, Saldi, Ryat, Rody, Harry, and Marie! Our interactions with Joy, in the beginning, were flawless, she delivered on every promise, and everything she coordinated for us was executed with precision. I wanted a specific birthday cake, and my wish was their command -- the cake was presented as I requested. If you want to escape daily life's stress, this is where you want to come. Don't look for loud parties and rowdy guests -- this place is for the mature, who enjoy eclectic energy and a quiet, serene environment. And oh yeah, I book my birthday trip for the following year, while still there!",5,positive,"January 27, 2022",Savaneta 356-A,"('Savaneta',)",,

Our villa, Isla Alistaire, was over the water with both an indoor & outdoor sleeping area. The views over the ocean are incredible & we enjoyed beautiful sunsets every night. The private plunge pool was perfect to cool off by day. The villa was well appointed with all the comforts of home - hair dryer, steamer, Nespresso coffee maker and mini fridge. Two large bathtubs, one inside & one out, were great for relaxing and taking in the incredible views. Joy in reservations assisted us with every detail and arranged a full itinerary -  dining both on-site and off-site, spa services, excursions around the island, and airport transfers. She is very knowledgeable of both the resort and the island, and gave recommendations for must-see's and do's. The entire staff treats you like \""familia\"" and greeted us by name every day. Brenda, Ben, Zaldy & Doniella who work primarily in the restaurant were extremely gracious and accommodating, taking care of every need with a smile. Gigi in housekeeping was terrific - thorough and friendly. The entire Front Desk staff was terrific - responding to every request via the app with immediacy. Gio, the property's driver, was accommodating to our requests for transportation to & from the airport, across the island for our excursions, and even short trips to the store or ATM upon request. We made friends quickly with the resort's 4-legged members of the family - Fluffy, Zoey & Princess made a home at our villa and we did not mind the company. We enjoyed a couples massage that was the best I've ever had (and I've had hundreds in the states). I even went back the day before we left for another one. The food at the resort is amazing - we enjoyed breakfast & lunch almost daily, as well as several dinners there. The private cabana at Old Man and The Sea was a perfect way to celebrate our special occasion.

This is the latter.  We have a great deal of travel experience in the Caribbean, Mexico, Costa Rica and Europe, including almost all the Windward Islands, Leeward Islands, BVI, USVI, and Belize.\n\nService.  We have never experienced better service, ever.  Everyone from senior management to the housekeeping staff bent over backwards to make our stay super special.  Many of the staff become our friends, and we exchanged telephone numbers.  It is like a family here, and we were adopted into this family without hesitation.  Maria was always there to greet us early in the morning and she was still there to say \u201Cgood night\u201D after our dinner as we headed back to our villa.  Wendel will serve your meal and play guitar\u002Fsing for your special occasion (our honeymoon) and always make you feel like the most important person in the world.  Zaldi will make the best Mojito, bring wine and appetizers to your villa, and pretty much anything else you need.\n\nFood.  Chef Jeff and \u201CMommy\u201D will blow your mind with the best food you can imagine.  I\u2019ve eaten tons of grouper over the years, but never prepared as perfectly as Chef Jeff did it.  And I told him so!  Next time that was available, Chef Jeff made it for us again\u2026.but this time without any other chef involved, then served it to us at our table.  Chef Jeff began to make special variations on the menu for us on a regular basis.  Mommy is amazing.  She does it all\u2026.her breakfast is to die for (especially the arapa with tuna \u2026. I know what you\u2019re thinking but, yes, it is GREAT for breakfast).  Mommy also fixed my wife\u2019s dress and removed a grease stain from another\u2014 on top of daily greeting with hugs and kisses (oh, my wife doesn\u2019t speak Spanish and Mommy doesn\u2019t speak English).   With rare exception (only the Flying Fishbone next door), we always regretted eating anywhere other than here.\n\nVillas.  We have the newest villa on the property.  It is a flagship villa that blew our mind.  There are a few more flagship villas over the water that are under construction.  We used the outdoor bedroom frequently for naps or sleeping over night.  It\u2019s a full, king size bed under a palapa.  There\u2019s an outdoor shower (I used every day), and outdoor tub made of stone (used almost everyday), a deck with lounge chairs, a dining table, and an oversized outdoor couch (about as wide as a full size bed). There\u2019s even more that I\u2019m not including.  Inside is beautiful too.  Our photos never really capture how wonderful it is.\n\nLocation.  We love snorkeling.  We would just swim from our villa to the reef (5 minutes), then swim another 5 minutes to the cut to swim outside the reef.  The corals and sea life were better here than almost anywhere we went, and we tried a lot of places.  The only place (maybe) better was Mangel Halto \u2014 your Google searches will say it is the best snorkeling on the island, and we agree.  It is only a few minutes away from our villa by car, a bit too far to walk.  It is probably better than outside the reef in front of our villa but not by much.  It is, after all, really the same corner of the ocean, just a few hundred yards away from here.  I rented a tank and reg, went back to Mangel Halto and enjoyed a great scuba dive there too.\n\nWe will come back.  No doubt.

data/ca/1158886/12915710/870122488.html,Aruba Ocean Villas,"""We stayed at the Isla Alistaire villa which is lovely, however the resort unfortunately has the worst service on the island by far and possibly anywhere we've been in the world. \nWe were here for my 40th birthday. \nI had previously emailed with someone who seemed to be a manager of some description or at least a higher level of staff, she was in charge of arranging what was needed before people arrived etc, when asked about breakfast we told Joy that my husband and I don't eat eggs and that I am gluten free, after asking for suggestions of what we eat for breakfast I gave her a range of food to which her response was that she would pass that on, that it was no problem and that they'd have something arranged for our breakfast.\nWhen the first morning came I was told the options were toast (gluten), eggs (the one thing outside of gluten neither of us eat), bacon (the only thing I could have eaten) and another kind of gluten wrap thing with veggies inside. \nDaniella, the server did go away to figure something out for us and we received our breakfast 30 mins later than planned, but they made something for us and that was good, it wasn't her fault, but this absolutely should have been pre-arranged as I was indicated it would be. \nThe dinner in the private water cabana the first night I told them I was gluten free, I received crutons on the salad I ordered (this can actually make people seriously unwell, so it's obvious the staff here have no actual training\u002F understanding of what gluten is and what it means to be gluten free\u002F celiac, so I would assume since this allergy is one of the more common they would not be good at fulfilling other allergy requests either. \nI also ordered the fish with risotto (I asked the waiter to check if the risotto was gluten free), he didn't come back to tell me otherwise, so I assumed it was probably fine, but when my meal turned up I received it with extra vegetables because there was flour in the risotto. The fact that the waiter didn't come back to tell me that or ask me if I would like to switch my order because of it was another service faulure. My husband's dish had potatoes which are of course gluten free and would have been a safe substitute and more filling with my meal. \nIt rained the first night and because of the gap between the roofs in our particular villa (I'm not sure if any other villas have the same issue) by the morning the toilet and waste paper basket with used waste paper (you are asked not to flush anything) had filled up with water and was of course disgusting, the toilet was also soaked and so we're the bathroom mats which is bad for molds and mildew because of the same flawed design in the roofs not connecting right at the point of the toilet and bathroom. \nI had to contact them twice in the morning to ask them to come and clean and then had to ask for the bathroom to also be done, not just the decks and for the mats to be switched etc (again you think that would be automatic considering they know the design flaw in this villa). \nWe were due to enjoy our at that point scheduled breakfast on the deck of our villa, so I was trying to make sure we wouldn't be having the cleaner in while also trying to eat (of course the breakfast ended up late so the point was moot).\nIf you know the villa has this issue (bathroom and toilet getting soaked in the rain) the staff should be messaging you first thing in the morning to ask if they can come and clean, you shouldn't be having to chase them down.\nThe power went out the first night which can happen and was resolved quickly, but our internet did not go back on. \nWe asked several times the next day for them to come and fix the internet, we were told the maintenance person would come and nobody came, so in the end my husband had to fix the router himself.\nDinner on our last night was arranged to eat in on our dock in our villa (so we could not leave and really relax before we were heading home), the next villa over a table cloth was automatically put out on to the table, we asked for one for our table and were told \""they had to go and check\"". The table in our villa was in numerous broken pieces (not the design or how it is supposed to be) and was not a pleasant surface to eat on in the first place because of this, the table should of course have been replaced with something not completely broken in a villa where you are charged $1100 a night. \nThey did eventually bring a table cloth. \nWhen the food arrived the appetizers were brought with our entrees at the same time (the salad again had crutons on it), in all of my travel around the world this has NEVER happened, it is restaurant 101, the most basic rule, you don't deliver the food all at once because of course something is going to get cold if you have a hot appetizer (which we also did). \nWe sent our entrees back explaining that they would be cold (unbelievable that I had to explain that). \nI messaged (you use WhatsApp to speak with the staff which sometimes you receive an answer to, sometimes you don't at all and other times you receive half answers and have to ask again to actually get your questions answered) to say we were done with our appetizers and to please bring our entrees back when there were WARM enough (I used caps to make the point that it needed to be reheated and couldn't just be returned cold).\nWell of course when they brought them back the plate at the bottom was luke warm, but the food was completely cold (I touched various pieces of the lamb to check on both plates). We returned the food and told them to cancel anything else and that we were leaving for dinner elsewhere (ruining our night that was supposed to be restful enjoying the villa). \nThey of course charged us for the appetizers upon our return.\nOther issues: \nThe villa has two bath tubs which is lovely, but when only hot water comes out of the outdoor shower and not out of the indoor or outdoor baths it makes the bath tubs irrelevant as nobody wants to soak in cold water otherwise you would just use the small pool or the ocean. The only thing that could make sense at all to us on this is that the tubs are not hooked up to the water heater? \nI tried to have a bath and my husband had a bucket and kept trying to bring me bucketfuls of hotter (not super hot but definitely has some heat compared to the tubs) water from the shower to get the tub warm (which still wasn't enough and I got out), you shouldn't have to work to enjoy a bath. \nWe had massages booked and nobody told us where to go to get the massage, I asked twice and wasn't answered.\nAgain this happened various times, us asking questions on the WhatsApp and only receiving partial answers or no answers and having to figure it out, this is not how a well trained hotel operates. \nAnyone who comes here and complains about bugs or nature is ridiculous because of course those things exist in a place like these villas and it is part of the charm, but when something like rain happens and they know it's a problem for a particular villa they should be on sorting that out, the overall dining experience there was terrible and for them to charge that kind of money you need staff and dining that matches those prices. \nBefore dinner upon arrival yesterday I had spoken to three groups of friends and we were all looking to book for a longer stay next year (this is our 8th time to Aruba), but after our experience I am now unable to in good conscious recommend it because there were too many failings in service.\nAgain I am a travel host for the American government's tourism program, this means I have traveled to many places and stayed in many hotels aside from my personal travel which has also taken me around the world (I am British and England is not known for their service), but the service there was the most disorganized and lacking I have ever experienced.\nLastly I contacted the owner of the villas with my experience, she saw both my messages on Facebook and didn't respond, so that again shows a lack of care and an absence of pride in wanting things to be better there. \nI contacted Joy also and was told a manager would be speaking with me before we checked out, as we were checking out they gave room our appetizers off from the night before, but no manager came to speak to me. \nI emailed Joy three more times to say nobody had come to speak to me, received apologies each time and was told each time by her someone would be in touch and thank you for my patience. \nI gave them every opportunity to respond to my issues before posting my review of this place and as it is now 5 weeks later and I still haven't heard from anyone I think they have proven over and over that they just don't know how to service people here, what good service is or how to actually run any business you want to succeed and have repeat customers from.\nThis place is far too expensive (a couple of 2 person villas here are $2400 a night, I would have been even more livid I'd paid that for this level of service) for what you get in return and there are far too many great hotels in Aruba for you to waste your money and what is supposed to be a relaxing time dealing with their failings. \nIt's possible they may respond to this review apologizing and saying someone will be in touch with me, but as I've been told that 4 times now and nobody has still bothered I won't be holding my breath. \n ",1,negative,"November 29, 2022",Savaneta 356-A,"('Savaneta',)",,

We were meeting some friends for a few days on the high-rise resort side of the island, and we wanted to extend our trip to stay somewhere more romantic for our 10-year anniversary. Coming to the Villas was like traveling to an entirely different island that managed to stay untouched by commercial tourism. I don't think there's anything else like it on the island. It felt more like we had been invited by a friend to stay at an exclusive tropical retreat than a stay at a hotel. We knew the staff by name on the first day, and they were so welcoming that we instantly felt the island hospitality upon arrival.\n\nWe split our time between Lou Lou and Joy, and both were amazing.

It doesn't feel like the beach resort you can find all over. We stayed in Villa Sophia. It is somewhat open air. The walls are largely glass doors that can be opened for a nice breeze. But even with the doors closed, the Tiki design allows airflow. This type of resort isn't for those seeking a chain-hotel room. The a\u002Fc to the bed worked great. The open air means the occasional tiny bird comes in during the day to say hello and fly back out. Although we did hike to the Natural Pool, visit town and snorkel from other beaches, we enjoyed our villa the most. It was so peaceful to sit and watch the sea from the patio. We enjoyed most of our meals on the patio, ordered through wifi and delivered to us. The service was the best we've experienced, beginning with the weeks before we arrived.

It depends.\n\nThis place is not for everyone. If you enjoy nature, and you don\u2019t mind the mosquitoes or the cats and dogs walking around the property\u2026 if you don\u2019t mind taking a shower with a giant bird hanging around next to you when you are trying to shower\u2026 or some frogs or some spiders \u2026\n\nThe biggest problem I think we had was our \u201Ccheap\u201D cabana (Joy) and the outdoor toilet. When we booked, there was no other one left, so we took it. I didn\u2019t realize the toilet was outside\u2026going out at night for a piss was not fun\u2026 lots of mosquitoes. I think many other cabanas don\u2019t have this issue and are nicer\u2026 so just be aware and choose wisely.\n\nI must say though that taking a shower by the moon light was pretty cool (minus the giant bird next to my head). Also, during our first night, the lights outside the \u201Cbathroom\u201D were not working, and the hot water was not working\u2026 which was pretty bad - they did fix both of them on the next day, but honestly kind of ruined one night for us\u2026 for $500+ a night, they didn\u2019t even try to compensate or anything, they just said they were sorry and fixed the issues. I also had to search and kill some small spiders in our room the first night..my wife was not happy. Even though they had another cabana available for that night, we were offered to pay the full rate difference with a small discount. Couldn\u2019t understand why, pretty disappointing.\n\nThe beach is beautiful but very small, since there only a few cabanas and some have their own private beach, you don\u2019t need to worry about crowds of course. Also, you can barely get in the water before the sargasso takes over\u2026 and it won\u2019t go past your chest, so don\u2019t think you will be hanging around in the water here much\u2026 even the cabanas that are on the water, just not happening\u2026\n\nThe staff and service in the restaurant overall was absolutely amazing. Everyone knew our names, they would do everything to make food and beverages to the best that they could.\n\nDining at the central table by the water was impossible because it was always booked, but we ended up having desert there one day because someone didn\u2019t show up\u2026 definitely something you should look for if staying there, just ask them right away to book it either at 6.30 or 8pm. If you can\u2019t, try waking up early and grab it for breakfast.\n\nFood was generally okay, nothing special, it has potential. The steak was a bit dry, the grilled garlic shrimp was okay. Breakfast was okay, fruits were fresh but bread and scrambled eggs were dry. They could easily get a better sourdough with some butter, and make the eggs a bit more creamy.\n\nFor dining, I\u2019d go next door to Flying fishbone anytime. The fried shrimp and the baked Alaska were fantastic there.\n\nDrinks \u002F cocktails were always pretty good in the bar area, the bartender Mike can make anything you want (pretty much)\u2026 however, by 10pm everything is closed, nobody at sight, no drinks.\n\nThe entrance is terrible as it seems they are under construction\u2026 smelled like a sewer too. No signs or anything to the hotel, some taxis wouldn\u2019t even wanna stop by the entrance because of the water outside\u2026 when it\u2019s finished, likely will be cool.\n\nSo\u2026 would I go back? Maybe for 2-3 nights tops\u2026 it is more than enough and definitely would look to stay in one of the fancier cabanas\u2026 there is really one or two I think I would stay again\u2026 the other ones, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the $800 or $1,000+ they ask a night.",3,negative,"August 6, 2022",Savaneta 356-A,"('Savaneta',)",,

The pictures on the website and on my camera roll are beautiful and the staff was very friendly but this property needs a LOT of work. Save your overwater bungalow \u002F villa for Maldives and stay elsewhere in Aruba.\n\nI honestly don't understand how it has such great reviews.The MOSQUITOES ARE AWFUL! I am bit from head to toe and that started at the check in desk. They are very aware of the issue as you will see mosquito coils all over the grounds and they will bring them to your room. They don't help. They also provide bug spray in your room. I'm questioning if all of my bites are even from mosquitoes since I was getting bitten all night even with the mosquito tent around the bed. We found several small spiders above our bed and something larger ran under our bed. I\u2019m still scratching as I write this review. \n\nAvoid staying in Chupi, especially if you are over 5'9\"".  You will have to duck constantly and everything is low (mirror, couch, etc). There is no table inside to eat or anywhere to put your suitcases. The bathroom is like a sauna. It would be better if it was outside like Joy or Lola because at least they have airflow. If you leave the bathroom door open, the rest of that level gets extremely hot. If you close the bathroom door; the bathroom is like an oven.  The shower floor is sloped away from the drain, so water floods outside the shower and onto the bathroom floor. It also saturates all the wood making the hot room smell even more musty. After my husband's shower I slipped on the tile and almost fell. \n\nThe big tub was beautiful but it was so hot in the room the last thing I wanted to do was take a bath. The standing water that was in the tub never dried.  \n\nThey ask that you not flush anything besides human waste. I have seen this in other countries but this really bothered my husband. Putting toilet paper in the garbage next to the toilet in a hot bathroom isn't the most glamourous \u002F romantic experience.\n\nThe stairs in Chupi are narrow. I was too scared to try to get my bag up to the top floor. There is no storage for your stuff or suitcase. I like to unpack and settle in but there was no place to hang up clothes (but there are hangers??) and only one small armoire upstairs. Chupi has a very awkward setup with a useless piano that looks pretty but is not practical.\n\nThey will have you sign a paper of their house rules (it's long) but they don't provide a copy. It says they are not responsible for your belongings but there was no safe in Chupi. \n\nYour room will only be serviced if you bring your key to the front desk. \n\nThe beach has beautiful furniture and lovely sunsets but the water itself is not beautiful. It was not clear and full of seagrass. I think they may be trying to fix this but we were really disappointed as we thought we would be able to spend the day swimming \u002F relaxing on the beach here. They have kayaks and a paddle board available as well as snorkel equipment. They also provided us with a cooler for our trip to Baby Beach. Definitely go to Baby Beach!\n\nOnsite restaurant food is great but expensive and bugs are an issue. I would recommend you come to the restaurant at sunset to take photos. Also Flying Fishbone and Zeerovers are walking distance. Everything on the menu is priced higher than you would expect. We had breakfast delivered to our room. Nothing to brag about. Water eggs and one day we asked for no tomatoes and onions but got them anyway. \n\nThere are 5 cats and a dog on property (for anyone with allergies).\n\nWe were woken up on our last morning by construction BEFORE 7am. We kept hearing a knocking sound and thought someone was at our door. Finally made it down and no one was there. So I got dressed and went outside and followed the noise to the construction site. When I confronted staff I was told they would look into it as construction doesn't start until 8am. We were never told that we would hear construction and they completely dismissed my complaint. I think that this should be disclosed to guests. We were so annoyed to be awoken that last morning we couldn't wait to leave.

Any problem was solved very quickly.\n\nAkram from the Watersports Center always finds the best places to see whale sharks, manta rays, turtles or corals during excursions and takes special care of beginners when it comes to snorkeling. Our family friend is not a swimmer, but learned to snorkel with the help of a life-saving vest. During our excursion to the reef, Akram accompanied her to the reef and back to the boat. She was very excited: she hadn't expected so many fish and corals and with Akram at her side she wasn't afraid.\n\nImportant: consideration is given to allergy sufferers. I have an allergy to house dust mites. The Beach Villa was prepared accordingly. For people with food allergies, the food is adapted so that they can enjoy the food safely. If necessary, Senthil will cook dishes that are not on the menu.\n\nI would especially like to thank\nSenthil (Assistant F&B Manager), who organized the preparation of our Beach Villa for my personal needs\nYuvaraj (Assistant FO Manager) who solved problems efficiently and unconventionally and\nSamsul and his boss Inaz, thanks to whose efforts I was able to sleep without asthma attacks.\n\nMy next stay on Centara is planned for Easter 2024\n",5,positive,1 week ago,,"('',)",,20217

This continued with Nur who welcomed us to the island and got us sorted for our week long stay.

The Club is an amazing facility within the resort, making you feel truly like rock stars.  Without kids, we would have stayed in The Club for our 7 day stay. If you get the chance, this is a must  Then there was Senthil, who made sure we were looked after from the time we woke, until we went to sleep at night.  These two members of staff are an amazing credit to Centara.  Other members of staff who made us feel at home and very welcomed include Roshan and Supun from Coral bar, Senthil (Chef), Sunny, Desmond and Jonathan from Azzuri, and the whole family is still talking abut the treatments received at the Spa from Patis and Susi.\n\nThe resort is small enough to snorkel around the various house reefs, with a great variety of things to see.  We also got very lucky on the day of our whale shark tour, being able to spend time with one of these amazing creatures,  The staff in charge made sure we had the best day in and out of the water.\n\nI would recommend having accommodation on the sunrise side of the resort, a beautiful way to start each day.

There are too many staff to name that were outstanding - Nazim, Senthil, Huhthu, Rohit, Jasim, Fizan, Sathish, Nabaa, Jaman, Sujith, Nalin, Pat, Jen, Ahu and Conq were all amazing (There were more!).  All staff said that they are treated well by management, which reflects.\n\nThis is one of the few places in the Maldives which kids can stay in the over water villas.  There was a fence and a gate which we can just go down and snorkel on their beautiful house reef.  Just around the island there were colourful fishes all around the resort, coral and even turtles!  Fizan was amazing in his knowledge of what we (including kids) want to see and how best to show us.  Conq and Ahu read us well too to show us a whale shark, turtles and manta rays.  These are experiences we would never forget.\n\nA pleasant surprise is the number of activities available to all residents - some paid and some free.  We could be as busy as we want, or free and easy.  Staff were so accommodating and understood us very well.\n\nOther amazing adventures were an excellent mixology class, PT training and spa.  We dined mostly at the Reef which was excellent, and the Thai restaurant one of the best we have tasted.

Accompanied with a rounded spacious jacuzzi, king size bed, and a double decker-bed room (with a PS4) the room is perfect for a family of 4-5 people with children. Yea, I spent some time on the PS4 myself. Room was very clean (I think they clean the room twice a day) and comfortable. \n\nThe resort was not short of activities and restaurants for us to choose from. The food was great and the activities were very fun and memorable - most activities are highly dependent on the weather though so fingers crossed! Did parasailing, whale shark snorkel (excursion staff were so helpful), house reef snorkel, seabob swimming (a must try!) and semi submarine. There were many other activities as well as a dive school too, good for beginners and advanced divers. After all those activities best way to relax and wind down with a massage at the cenvaree spa!! Honestly, best spa i ever had (regretted taking only 1 hour). There are group games every night at the coral bar, like bingo night, crab racing (yes that's right, real crab) etc. before the dance floor opens - i think we owned the dance floor on our last night there - general music could have been better though, but we can make our requests to the DJ, so all's good. \n\nThere were a few restaurants for us to choose from, italian, western, indian, thai, local food were all available across 3-4 restaurants on the island. Thai food was one of the best for me at Suan Bua and for atmosphere the bbq food by the beach at reef restaurant on our last night was a good way to end off the trip! Spectacular! \n\nHad an issue with my luggage upon arrival, issue was with the seaplane, had to wait for the next morning for my luggage to arrive but the staff was so responsive, reactive and helpful! They checked with the airport and seaplane company on the fastest next course of action and checked in with me to provide updates and even provided me with clothes and footwear for the night to ensure that i am comfortable. Got my luggage first thing in the morning at 7am. \n\nOverall the trip was splendid, truly a perfect getaway from the daily work hustle. My partner and I loved everything about the trip and keep on reminiscing about the times we had on the resort. I think the best thing about the resort would be the staff as they are very friendly. Every staff you walk past will greet you with a big smile and if you're in the mood can have a short chat along the way.

The island is physically bigger than it looks in the photos and the accommodation is perfect for us.

Shout out to Nasir who has kept our villa spotlessly clean and tidy for us.. Thank you! \n\nAll of the team on the island are friendly and go out of their way to make your stay ad great as possible.

Plenty of space, comfy, attended to perfectly - shout out to Monir who turned down our room, he did some amazing decorations for us most nights and was always friendly when we saw him. I did worry about being on the end villa when the weather was bad, but even during the few storms we had it felt very stable and the noise didn't seem too bad so there must have been some kind of noise proofing too. I did hope there'd be some kind of shade on our deck so we'd have the option of that when we wanted to sit outside there, but I didn't miss it in the end although some people might.\n\nLoved the food and drinks - with a mix of Italian, Thai, and buffet there was always plenty of choice and we always enjoyed what we had - the fettucine alfredo with salmon in Azzuri Mare was amazing (wish I'd asked for a recipe for that one!) and the green forest cocktail became a favourite too! The service was great everywhere, especially Sunny in Azzuri Mare was so friendly and even had some great advice about other parts of the island such as snorkelling. We really enjoyed the thai cooking class too. Generally we liked that there were two bars because it meant we could have a more chilled out night at the floating bar when we wanted, but have a bit more fun with music and activities on the island bar if we wanted.\n\nGeneral facilities were great on the island, and although there was work going on sometimes it never felt intrusive. The spa was an amazing place, beautifully decorated and the music and facilities were the best I've ever seen. We had couple's experiences as well as individual ones and the massage workshop, so relaxing and they were fantastic at working on specific issues too. The pool was lovely, didn't think we'd use it with the snorkelling opportunities available but it was actually great when the weather wasn't quite clear enough for snorkelling because it was still peaceful and warm by the pool. And everything was always clean whether that was the bars, pool, restaurant, toilets. Although it's a child friendly island with a kids club we still felt like we were on a relaxing adult holiday, the few children we saw were well behaved and happy, the island was big enough while still feeling like an intimate island.\n\nActivities wise we tried quite a few, enjoyed the sunset fishing and cruises, and our favourites were doing quite a few snorkelling trips where we were lucky enough to see things on every trip we went on (whale sharks, turtles, manta rays). I was nervous of snorkelling in open water at first but we found the staff on these trips were brilliant and made us feel so safe, especially Ziku - he was so knowledgeable about the sea life and was really chatty, and seemed to really look after people who weren't as comfortable and seemed to be really good with children we saw on the trips too. We got confident enough to go solo snorkelling ourselves every day we could in the end, and the sea life even on the island itself was amazing despite some coral bleaching - we saw turtles, rays, sharks and so many types of fish snorkelling right from our villa as well as from the dive centre. The dive centre was great too - when there was trips we wanted to do but they weren't full enough, they were brilliant in rearranging and keeping us updated as to when there was enough bookings to do them. \n\nExperience wise, yes the island itself and the facilities are amazing, but it also just seemed like all the staff there would chat or remember your favourites and just generally be happy, you don't always get that everywhere you go! Senthil in particular was fantastic, he would always remember what we had planned on the island or would ask us how past activities went, and was so quick and helpful arranging special activities like our beach dinners and the room decoration that was a surprise for my husband (although we were asked to sign for the extra decorations in our room when my husband was there, luckily he thought it was for the decorations we'd already had and not the extras I was planning but maybe something to check next time!)\n\nWe said it was a once in a lifetime holiday but now we're definitely trying to work out if\u002Fwhen we can come back \u2764\uFE0F\n\n",5,positive,"September 21, 2023",,"('',)",,20217

First and foremost we didn\u2019t get a meet and greet at the airport or on arrival at the resort. We were rushed to the buffet restaurant so that we could eat before it closes. My first 4 days were absolute waste, I had to request to meet the resident manager Mr Nalin, which means we were unknow to the resort. I booked a Grand all inclusive package and this was the treatment. After contacting Mr Nalin, he tried to make up for the loss by providing entry to the Club. The water sports guys are absolutely disgusting and  misleading. They didn\u2019t want to honour any of the reservations until were intervened by the senior staff. I would not knock down all the staff as the members at the Saun Bua restaurant specially the chef Chai chin and Swapnil are star servers so are the guys at Azzuri Mare, the Chef Justin is a star and always trying to please the servers.

He also quickly and efficiently dealt with a cut I sustained to my leg during the trip. The only reason for giving our room a 4\u002F5 is that towards the end of the holiday the air con unit in our beach villa started spitting out ice and leaking water through the ceiling. But I rang reception and within a few minutes someone was in our room fixing it and it was all sorted out very quickly. Otherwise the room was perfect and very often it felt like we had our own private beach as the stretch outside our room was so quiet. The only things we were a bit disappointed about were not being able to go parasailing because the boat was waiting to be fixed and the sunset yoga classes were not available the week we were there either.

There is an abundance of marine life, beautiful fish, sharks, diffrent kinds of rays and turtles that you get to see on every single snorkeling session.

The atmosphere and setting were perfect and the food was top class, even by italian fine dining standards. A big thank you  to Chef Jithin! This guy is a real treasure, a top class chef and also a sweet and warm person. We couldn\u2019t get enough of his delicious dishes and i have to say we are pretty picky. \uD83D\uDC4F\uD83D\uDC4F\uD83D\uDC4F\nWe also had dinner at the Thai restaurant and it was realy good too (especialy if you like spicy food).\nThe main buffet restaurant Reef was also good. The breakfast had eggs and pancakes stations, also a decent selection of other kind of foods, nothing to complain about. Probably they could make some improvements for lunch and dinner, as the selection was mostly oriented to asian and indian dishes. I would rate the Reef restaurant for lunch and dinner at 3 stars out of 5, but this is not a big deal if you are on the GAI plan as you can dine at the mutch better a la carte restaurants. There is also the option to eat at the pool bar where they have a decent selection of finger food like burgers, wings and club sandwiches of good quality. \nDrinks are also of good quality and variery all around the island with very good cocktails and wines available especialy if you are on the GAI plan. \n- the room. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 kids (9 and 11yo). The duplex beach villa was a perfect choice for us. The layout is ideal for a family, spacious enough, confy king bed upstairs, a sofa bed and an extra bed downstairs, nice and big main bathroom on the ground floor and a toilet upstairs. The villa is not new, very modern or exquisite but we realy did not have anything to complain about. The A\u002FC worked very well, the wifi was surprinsingly good, the terrace and sunbeds right on the superb beach were wonderful. Also our house keeper Samsul did an amazing job, always smiled and asked if we need anything. He made some amazing towel-sculptures and decorations that we all loved. Hats off for this hard-working and sweet guy. \n- the excursions were also excellent! We got to see the whale sharks wich is a real bucket-list experience. The guides and staff from watersports center were all great people and they did everything they could to make us feel good and have the best experiences possible. The only remark i have is that they need a faster boat! The one they are using now is a slow old traditional boat that is not very suitable for \u201Cchasing\u201D the whale sharks and makes the trips to diffrent locations too long.\nOther things to be mentioned:\n- go for the GAI (gold\u002Fgrand all inclusive plan)! It\u2019s a bit more expensive but the inclusions are very very good: a la carte restaurants dining every day, 3 excursions (including whale shark one), premium drinks (including a bottle of good wine in the room every day), 200$\u002Fperson spa credit (spa is of good quality too), a 15 min banana\u002Finflatable ride that the kids will love. This is a great value package in my opinion. \n- Go for the duplex beach villa. They are placed in the most beautiful side of the island and i think they offer the best value\u002Fmoney ratio. \n- There were basicly no mosquitos around the island or in the room. They fumigate every evening around the island and it works very well.\n-  We were on the island during Halloween and they did a fantastic job celebrating this ocasion! They made realy amazing decorations, lights, moving skeletons, face painting for guests and even guys disguised in various creepy characters walking around the island. They realy went above and beyond with this ocasion. The kids greatly enjoyed this and we realy apreciated their effort as we were not expecting much of a big deal of this celebration on an small remote island in the Indian Ocean! \n- There are a few places that are in need of some updating, like the toilets in the common areas, but these are just small issues that don\u2019t affect the overall excelent quality of the stay.\n- Please don\u2019t touch the wild life or stand on the corals! This island is a true gem and all guests shoud respect and protect this natural beauty. \uD83D\uDE0A\nAs i mentioned before, this is our 4th time in Maldives, and we stayed and much more luxurious and expensive resorts, but this one was by far the best one overall.

The diving is more expensive than we have had at other resorts in the Maldives but there is a superb wreck to explore close to the dive centre and a lovely house reef.

Satish, Roshan, Anil were great to have at the bar. We took the all inclusive package which is a must when staying at a resort like this.

This was our fifth Maldives trip and we stayed in a different resort every time.  Centara has one of the best house reefs compared to the others.  I also feel that Centara has the best overall value.\n\nWe arrived late in the evening and stayed overnight in Male.  The next day we took the 9:45 am seaplane to the resort.  Resort manager Pat showed great hospitality and showed us around the island.  She let us check in early as soon as our villa was available. \n\nWe stayed in the Premier Overwater Bungalow.  We were very pleased with the layout, privacy and cleanliness of the villa.  The best thing of the villa was the view and the fact that there were so many coral and colorful fishes around the villa.\n\nThe next day was our Anniversary.  Pat surprised us with a bottle of champagne and a cake which we brought to dinner with us.   They decorated the table when we arrived the Thai restaurant.  People worked in the Thai restaurant were very nice and the food was really delicious. \n\nWe had breakfast and dinner buffet in Reef restaurant most of the time.  They had a wide variety of cuisine, and we loved the feeling of dining on sand.  Reef restaurant had live music most of the nights and the staff were very friendly.   Outside Reef restaurant you can see baby sharks swimming.  Next to Reef Restaurant was the Bar and we participated in Karaoke two times.  Good fun.\n\nAugust was raining season and there were days we couldn't snorkel.  We snorkeled in the house reef next to Dive Center twice.  The coral and variety of marine life was truly amazing there.  We also dived once to the shipwreck close to the resort.  We would recommend the Whale Shark Snorkel excursion which we were able to see the majestic creature and many dolphins.\n\nWhen we leave the manager on night shift was very efficient and accommodating.  He let us stay till the seaplane pick us up and recommended things for us to do in Male before our late-night flight.\n\nThe resort was well-managed and gave us a home feeling.

data/ca/13456104/1576423/919732582.html,Centara Grand Island Resort &amp; Spa Maldives,"""This was our 4th island in the Maldives & by far the best!\n\nIf you are looking for some of the most incredible reefs in the world which you can snorkel from your doorstep then this is the island for you! We have snorkeled all over the world from the Great Barrier to the Red Sea & the reef at Centara surpassed both! The sheer amount of life on the reef blew us away. On previous reefs we have been lucky to see maybe one or two moorish idols\u002FOriental sweetlips...here....i lost count how many we saw each time we went into the water! Absolutely breathtaking & for that reason alone we would return.\n\nI do wish it was better advertised that they had a marine biologist on site. We searched the app top to bottom & there was no mention anywhere! It wasn't until we mentioned it to the manager on the last day that he told us they did have one. It would be great to have a section on the app about this. \n\nWe stayed first of all in villa 78 (premier water villa) & then upgraded to villa 68 (Water villa with pool) for our last 3 nights. I wish we stayed in villa 78 for longer as the reef outside was even more incredible than in the area beside 78! The villas themselves were absolutely beautiful. Spotlessly clean & housekeeping were excellent.\n\nThe staff on this island were just incredible! Every single staff member you passed would great you with a hello & a smile. In the restaurants the staff automatically knew your room number. What really impressed me was when we moved rooms i went to advise the team in the restaurant & they already knew & knew the room we had relocated to! How flawless is that?!\n\nThe island itself is the smallest we've stayed on but we loved that everything was within a max ten minute walk. \n\nFood wise - my husband is a very picky eater & although he didn't have an abundance of choice in the buffet he did always manage to find something to eat. It's the first all inclusive we've been to that didn't have themed nights in the buffet. It would be great if they could introduce that instead of it being the same cuisines each night. (In my opinion the food was amazing, lots of Indian, Chinese, South East Asian). They did have a live cooking area that changed every day.\n\nThe A La Cartes were good. The Italian i wish we had explored earlier as it was amazing! The pizza was just as good as we had had earlier that year in Roma. They did always seem to be out of something though. On both trips the desserts i wanted were both unavailable. The first time i was offered an alternative, the 2nd trip no alternative was offered. \nThe Thai a la carte i had been really looking forward to. When asked how i wanted my Thai red curry i said spicy. The waiter marked it as medium. This curry had never even saw a chili in it's life! I know i don't look as though i can handle heat but please when someone asks for something spicy please make it authentic Thai spicy! \n\nThe way the a la cartes worked was you booked in advance & they had a different a 3 course lunch each day. When we tried to book the Italian we were advised that day it was closed which was a pity as it was the menu we both would've enjoyed most. Would it perhaps be a better way to operate by having a larger 3 course menu with say 4 options for starter\u002Fmain\u002Fdessert & keep that as the lunch menu (or change it weekly) then have a different set menu for dinner? (The Italian was set menu for lunch or $40 credit for dinner. Thai was set menu for both or $40 credit). \n\nThe spa was out of this world! I was a little disappointed that the spa was just the room you had the massage, no water\u002Fsauna area like what I'd saw advertised online.  Not sure if it was closed? We were not told anything about it or offered it. \n\nWhen we upgraded to the water villa with pool we had asked about the island club. The answer we had was strange. We were told it wasn't really being used but then every day at different times we saw people using it? It would've been nice to have been given some more information on it. Even if it was an upgraded cost to use it. \n\nEven though it seems like there were a few niggles i can assure you these are all just some constructive criticism. This island blew us away. I could go on & on forever about how incredible our stay here was. We will 100% be returning on our next Maldives trip! \n\n",5,positive,"October 4, 2023",,"('',)",,20217

As soon as we set foot on the scenic jetty we knew we had found a unique property. The sparkling clear turquoise waters were impressive, even by Maldives standards, and the welcoming team made us feel instantly at home. We stayed in the Two Bedroom Beach Villa with Private Pool which incorporated separate rooms and bathrooms for the children and parents as well as a comfortable lounge area, large outdoor deck, and refreshing pool. We were set right in the sand with spectacular views and just steps to the crystal clear ocean. The water was calm and inviting, suitable for young swimmers and great for families to enjoy together.\n\nActivities were endless at Centara Grand Maldives, so whether you\u2019re looking to relax poolside or dive and snorkel with majestic marine life the team are on hand to make all the arrangements. We loved the semi-submarine where we spotted a huge array of tropical fish and even the resident turtle. Centara boasts an abundant house reef which can\u2019t be missed and we loved spotting the many species that call the island home. Our son learned to snorkel during our stay and swam beside one of the biggest turtles we\u2019ve ever seen. The five star resort also offers expert diving courses for 8 years old and up with fun sessions specifically for beginner children. Being located in the South Ari Atoll means the resort is in a marine protected area known as SAMPA, the world\u2019s most unique and significant sites for whale sharks. Centara organises boat trips with their knowledgeable dive team to well known sites where you have the chance to see and swim with these incredible creatures. A bucket list experience for the whole family.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to relax and unwind, drop the children off at the fully staffed kids club and indulge in a couples massage at the world class spa. The Kids Club crew kept our little ones busy with a plethora of exciting activities from t-shirt painting and cupcakes decoration to fun games indoors and outdoors with their new friends. We recommend watching the sunset while enjoying a cocktail or mocktail crafting session and don\u2019t miss the captivating fish feeding where you\u2019ll encounter a large number of reef sharks and stingrays each evening.\n\nDining options were a big highlight throughout our stay from mouthwatering seafood and Italian fare at Azzuri Mare to a decadent lobster dinner at The Club. If you\u2019re craving authentic Thai fare check out Suan Bua or book a cooking session so you can learn from the talented chef. Our most unforgettable evening was the private movie night under the stars where we enjoyed a gourmet dinner in the sand. Upgrade your experience and enjoy exclusive access to The Club. The luxurious space boasts a tranquil private pool and beach and decadent a day a la carte dining.\n\nNot only did we love all the five star facilities, amazing beaches and fun filled activities but we felt right at home because of the amazing staff and crew at Centara Grand Maldives. Everyone from the chefs and waitstaff to bartenders, housekeeping, and managers went out of their way to acquaint our family, care for our children, and ensure guests feel like they\u2019re holidaying in a home away from home.

We stayed for a week and had a fantastic time! We have traveled to several other locations in Mexico and stayed at different resorts, including others within the Villa Group. The overall stay at this resort was a very positive experience. The studio room was very clean and had a view of one of the pools. The pool itself was very clean, refreshing, and always comfortable. We had a refrigerator problem and reported it, and a new refrigerator was brought up within an hour, on a Sunday! There were lots of activities at the resort, several great places to get food, and just outside of the resort there are also a variety of places to dine. This was an excellent choice for us to stay here, even though there was a noise problem from a motorcycle with an alarm that went off for a few hours one day. We called the front desk to report the noise and it was taken care of soon afterwards, but turned out to be from an adjacent hotel parking lot, not the resort we were in.\n\nI want to be honest and say that each resort I've stayed at has varying levels of quality in terms of the rooms, pools, activities, and the staff. This resort is very good, but it isn't actually the property that has left me wanting to return. It really is a great resort and I highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Puerto Vallarta.\n\nWhat made this resort such a great choice for us was actually the incredible staff and people we encountered here. The pool concierge, Roberto, was absolutely great! He introduced himself to us and then visited often over the course of the week we stayed there. On our anniversary day, Roberto brought us a special cake out by the pool, and greeted us with coffee that was decorated with our names and little hearts. This was unexpected and really made the experience great for us! We had our anniversary dinner downtown, and with assistance from another staff member, Martin, I was able to arrange a surprise for my girlfriend, including flowers at our table when we arrived. Martin made several phone calls to assist me with coordination and he helped to ensure that everything was well planned. The service staff around the pool were also very kind and responsive, with exceptional service by Cinthia and Rafael, both of whom were always on the move, smiling, and bringing drinks and food to everyone around the pools. We had assistance with planning some activities from Marcela, and she was helpful in booking a small group visit to Yelapa. Although we ended up not taking the Yelapa trip because of other personal choices, I appreciate how Marcela handled the coordination. The staff at this resort all seem to have an exceptional enthusiasm, and clearly enjoy being part of the team there. I was impressed and took some time to pass on my feedback to the management.\n\nI met and spoke with Ricardo about how impressed I was by the enthusiasm of some of the people he manages, and others outside of his direct management. In particular, I noted that Roberto was especially noteworthy.

It's far enough away from the busy downtown area and about a 20 min bus ride to the Malecon (downtown area). \nResort is about a 15 min ride from the airport. \nBEACH: Always cleaned the night before and ample chairs and umbrellas available each day. Clean towels are provided every day and they allow you to use extra! We always felt safe on the beach. Venders do approach you but they were friendly as we said no thank you. We actually made friends with a few local venders. The parasailing is right next door. It was Fun to watch. A lot of guests were also using the bay to swim. \nPOOLS: . They have a BIG pool with a fun slide and a smaller pool closer to the beach. There is another area that has a 3rd medium size pool. This is a much quieter area. We did use this pool 1 day. It's very relaxing. It's right by the fitness center and did not seem to get used as much as the big pool area. There are 2 adult only hottubs. \nROOMS: are a great size and were cleaned each day and resocked. I am picky with cleaning and they did a great job. We were facing the pool and had a beautiful view of both the pool and the bay. The balcony is a nice bonus. The hotel did not seem to wake up until 10ish. Our friends stayed on the side facing the busy street. I did not like this nor did they. Pay extra to face the pool and don't stay in the 2nd building unless you face the pool. We had a studio with 2 double beds. I believe all rooms have a kitchenette? Kitchenette is small but workable. Rooms have a coffe pot, blender and all the dishware and cookware needed. No oven but they have a cook top. Mini refrig with a small freezer. Local grocery store is only a 5-7 min walk away. We did NOT do all-inclusive. We did notice several other guests with wrist bands and the wait staff seemed to be available throughout the day. Even on the beach.\nFOOD: We had chicken strips- I would buy again and a few blended drinks. Not a fan of the drinks - they were watered down and too expensive. We also ate at the deli. We ate subs and had ice cream. Prices are what you would expect for a hotel.\nBONUS: There is a food park directly across the street and the food and drink are super afforable and very good. We ate there most nights. There is a good variety of foods. \nCONS: They do try to sell you timeshare but we said no thank you and they left us alone. Listed this as a con but we never felt pressured. \nCheck in lines were long when and there were only 2 people helping. Wish that would have gone faster.

It was not a smooth experience based on 1 hurricane and sporadic service issues. Overall, the staff continue to shine and have excellent customer service skills. The exceptions fall to the \u201Cpool police\u201D who arbitrarily clear pool chairs in the early morning even when occupants are in the pool or having breakfast. Management has gone all out in providing high decibel music at poolside, especially on Sunday afternoons when live bands with extremely limited talent shriek off key and drive people away from the pool. They also have the same propensity for music during dinner, placing sound systems and live performers next to diners, making reliance on American Sign Language mandatory. We do recommend all of the on-site restaurants with the exception of the Japanese restaurant which was not really Asian but more of a Mexican\u002Fspaghetti fusion. The all-inclusive meal plan continues to be a reasonable investment since the A la carte choices for food and drink are expensive. The physical property is showing it\u2019s age, with the first ground floor 1-bedroom assigned in terrible condition, with a non- working microwave, patio doors that wouldn\u2019t open, a kitchen cabinet door hanging off its hinges and bedroom lampshades hanging off the lightbulbs.

We were in town to see Russell Peters at Casino Rama. Our stay was alright, the bathroom sink was dirty and there were questionable stains on the chair at the desk. Other than that, we didn\u2019t think much of it. The morning of December 11th, we checked out. Upon driving home I realized I had left my two diamond rings (one being my engagement ring on the bathroom counter. We called immediately and drove back. They searched the room and so did my fianc\u00E9e and I. They were no where to be found. We then told the manager to call the local  police (because I was 100% positive I left it there). I leave the room to meet my fianc\u00E9e and the manager at the front desk to call the police.

The hotel itself is nice and in a great spot to go to Rama or downtown Orillia. Check in\u002Fout was easy and quick. Dave the shuttle driver was such a gentleman and very sweet - though the lack of communication between the shuttle and the hotel was horrific and as I result we missed our dinner reservation and was almost late for our show. \n\nThe pool is under renos and they must have some deal with Rama, so we were able to use their facilities. Neither of us had been before so we really weren't sure where to go and Dave was kind enough to drop us off at the hotel entrance. He said to call the hotel when we needed to be picked up and let them know to tell him to pick up at the hotel entrance. \n\nNow just keep in mind that the shuttle is not part of the hotel and is a separate service\u002Fcharge, but the lack of communication was ridiculous considering this company was transporting their paying guests from hotel to casino and back.\n\nWe called the hotel around 520pm, as it's a quick ride and doesn't take too much time to get ready and make it back in time for dinner. I explained the situation to the woman on the phone and the response I was given was \""If he comes inside, I'll tell him.\"" ...if? The reception desk is maybe 5 steps from the door and is completely open concept so they can see the shuttle coming up. For the price, we'd naturally assumed customer service would be decent, but it seemed the woman too busy to pass that message (we later found out that he had very well been in and out of the hotel at the time of this request, but more on that after).  \n\nMy boyfriend called about 25 minutes later to see what was going on and the response was, \""if you're where the shuttle drops off, you should see it.\"" Keep in mind, we'd already explained the situation and had no idea where this drop off spot was. About 20 minutes after that with still no shuttle, I was pretty upset as we had now missed our reservation, so I called again. I explained to the same woman, for the third time, the situation and the response was a snarky attitude saying that they had spoken to the driver (they didn't) and that we must go to the drop off spot. \n\nUnderstandably I was livid as the shows start time was coming up and we hadn't had a meal yet. We found where the spot was (on the other side of Rama) and even then we were still waiting 15 minutes so we caught a cab instead (was cheaper, so is uber, but not many around). Fast forward through the amazing show and casino fun, we go back to grab the shuttle to the hotel and I see Dave. Dave asked why we hadn't called for pick up and I went on to explain to him what had happened. Dave was disappointed and told me that the hotel has a history of not doing so well helping relay messages between driver and guests, which in my opinion is irresponsible. They say the shuttle ends at 1am, but Dave informed me that when he was done his shift at 130, there would be another driver, to just call the hotel, just in case we wanted to go back.\n\nIt's obvious they hike the price for nights there are shows across the street, but the customer service is nothing like I've seen. Since there's a raise in price anyway, save yourself the trouble and attitude from the brunette with red-framed glasses and just stay at Rama.

Also take a large Jug\u002FThermos they will fill it at the bar and most Americans use this so no little cups.\n\nROOMS: This was the biggest let down of the holiday, we arrived and had 2 Double beds but I have 2 teenage boys so called reception and they said they can make up the sofa bed which really is just a sofa with the back cushions off which was very uncomfortable so the boys had to rotate to main bed each night to keep fair. \n\nThere isn't really any upgrade even in the swim up with no separates rooms so if you are with kids of any age you won't get any privacy. \n\nWe had a leak from the light fixing in the bathroom and called reception, they said they'd fixed it later on but then the ceiling started to look wet like the light had been sealed down, we phoned again and they didn't really do anything, the same day the inside door handle came off and again this was never fixed!. \n\nLOCATION: The Barcelo Maya Complex is huge and beautiful but is very isolated, you are over 1hr from the Cancun City so not easy to go anywhere as there's nothing else around apart from the Cenotes over the road which we did visit and HIGHLY recommend, cost was \u00A37 pp and fills in a few hours. \n\nGUESTS:  95% are American and Canadian and they use it as a short break location like a Brit would Spain for eg, a point worth nothing and has been mentioned alot previously is there are allot of 18-20 Yr olds in groups that go clubbing at night and are not quiet ie singing and shouting at 4am etc, they come here because they get served Alcohol unlike in USA being aged at 21, I'm 41 and completely understand but be aware they can be VERY loud and larey at times and many people complained. \n\nCONCLUSION: I highly recommend this hotel and it is so chilled compared to Europe, the beaches are clean and clear, with soft sand, coral reef and plenty of Fish and Turtles to see... Including Sting rays and Great Barracudas. \n\nIf you take the above on board you'll have an AMAZING time for all the family. \n\n\u2600\uFE0F\uD83C\uDF79\u2600\uFE0F\uD83C\uDF79\u2600\uFE0F\uD83C\uDF79\u2600\uFE0F\uD83C\uDF79\u2600\uFE0F",4,positive,"June 6, 2023",Carretera Chetumal-Puerto Juarez Km. 266.3,"('',)",Yucatan Peninsula,77750

We stayed for 10 days at the caribe hotel. Before going i messaged the hotel asking about upgrades for our anniversary and they said they would have a cake and champagne on arrival in our room. That never happened. When we arrived nobody offered to take our suitcases to the room, which is a bit annoying when the rooms are far away and we just had an over 10hr flight! The first 2 days our rooms weren\u2019t cleaned so i had to ask reception for our rooms to be cleaned (they even ask you when checking in how often you want it cleaned and we asked for every day) then at the end of the holiday our room wasn\u2019t cleaned for another 2 days in a row and i had to go back to reception! Once is okay, twice is frustrating. Our nearest buffet restaurant was very poor. Food was always cold, the variety of food was poor every day. We ended up walking to another buffet which was bigger, had more selection and the food was hotter. Our nearest pool was also very dirty, and the whole time we saw nobody clean it (you could tell nobody cleaned it also). Lots of deck chairs available, never had issues getting any. However a lot had bird poo on, they weren't cleaned off. The wifi is only good in the rooms and goes off a lot. Our room was very outdated, lots of bad repairs! However they top up the drinks fridge for free every day which is great. The towels had a lot of yellow stains on, some having holes in. The floor was also very dirty. Entertainment wasn\u2019t bad, staying for 2 weeks wouldn\u2019t be too fun as they repeat the same stuff each week. The shops are a rip off at the resort. \u00A315 for a pack of walkers crisps, \u00A340 for some ibuprofen, crazy! Was cheaper going into playa del carmen and getting some! (Go to 5th avenue, food, party and shops all on a very long road) the staff in the restaurants and buffets are all very friendly. When coming to checking out, we asked prior if we could have our room or another room to get showered and changed. As the taxi was coming ti get us 4 hours after check out time and we wanted to make the most of the sun and sea before going. Reception said that all the rooms had people in, but i could book plenty of rooms at the hotel online, for the day before and the day of our check out. So essentially we were lied too. Id rather they told us we cant or that its unfair on the cleaners ect. I would certainly not go back to this hotel.

There is a double-decker bus that takes you from one property to another all day long every 5 minutes if you don't feel like walking.\nNice decoration, Mayan and Mexican wall decor throughout the whole complex.\n\nCheck-in was in the premium lounge, short wait and friendly service, we got our room at 3:00 pm but had lunch while waiting.\nWe had a swim-up room at Caribe and it was perfect for us, our 2 children 9 and 11 enjoyed it so much, having the pool right there was awesome and so fun for them and us too.\nThe room was spacious, had a king-size bed and 2 sofas\u002Ftwin beds, we had a hot tub in our pool patio as well and it was perfect for relaxing while kids enjoy the pool.\nThe air conditioning worked well and the room was cleaned every day.\nThe pools were refreshing and there was always something fun going on, the bars by the pools were always full but service still was fast as it could be and friendly.\nThe ocean was beautiful! minimal sargassum and perfect temperature, we follow all the tips in this group and got to see the turtles!! amazing!!the best thing!!! Turtles swimming free in their natural setting!! the beautiful spectacle of nature!!do it if you can, right by the Palace beach.\n\nThe premium was a good choice for us, our room was close to everything, in front of the pools and the ocean.\ncheck-in and out were faster in the premium lounge.\nPremium grants you access to the Palace and all its restaurants as well.\nHydrotherapy was one of the best perks of the premium level for us, it was a great relaxing time for my husband and me, beautifully calm and peaceful area, with steam rooms, hot tubs, and jet pools, you get an hour every day if you want to book it.\nDinner reservations were also easy and another good perk of premium, we chose the places and times we wanted every night, and we also got room service with premium.\n\nThe food at the buffet was ok, it did get repetitive after a few days but still, we always found something to eat, there were always fruits, salads and meets, good coffee machines, and ice cream.\nPalace Buffet was better, we tried to get there for breakfast or lunch every day.\nWe enjoyed all the A la Carte restaurants very much, we tried Brasserie and it was delicious food and great ambiance, the Rodizio and Marenostrum were excellent too! Tokio was a fun dinner.\nWe saw the magician show and Michael Jackson show, that one was my son\u2019s favorite, 9:30 was a little late for us so we didn\u2019t try to go to any other.\nThe kids loved the flow rider, the instructor was so nice and did a great job with the kids, we wanted to do it again but it was always booked the times we went there.\nThe staff was great, hard-working people, friendly and welcoming, please do tip when you can, they are so grateful and deserve it.\nNothing negative or worth mentioning for us, We were there to have a great time and we did, there is always room to improve but that is everywhere I think.\nWe made the best of our vacation and enjoyed the hotel for sure.\nWe recommend it, yes!!it is a fun place, especially for families.\nWe made some great memories and had a wonderful vacation.",4,positive,"July 9, 2023",Carretera Chetumal-Puerto Juarez Km. 266.3,"('',)",Yucatan Peninsula,77750

That said they were clean and well maintained and perfectly fine. \nThere are 4 different pools to choose between as well as the beach and all have a different vibe so it\u2019s worth looking around to find your spot!

The Club personnel are non-responsive, unprofessional and failed to provide the accommodations we had reserved 8 months in advance.  Both Diana and Mina were in email exchanges with me through the time prior to our arrival and did not acknowledge my request for \""connecting rooms\"" which was specified in the original reservation. When we arrived we were given a different set of rooms (not-connected) and made our stay absolutely hell since we have teen girls and we wanted them to be connected to our swim up suite. Also, upon arrival no one from the club received us despite emailing twice of our arrival time. We called the club and first they answered and said they would send someone, but no one came. Then, when Veronica (reception host) called again, they did not answer. We had to accept the reservation for the wrong suites and it ended up leaving a bad taste in our souls.

A waitress has taken trash from other families and when I went to hand her my cup, she pointed me to the trash can. But today, takes the cake.

Today we decided to venture out, spent most of the day on the beach of the maya caribe.  Just after noon we thought (4adults) we would take in the pool\u002F music  at the caribe pool bar. First my wife spent 20 min at the pool bar attempting to get a drink,there was a  rather large mexican crowd( expected on weekends). Crowd was not big enough to justify what she felt,  being ignored by bar staff. I thought I would try myself to get a drink, another 20 min waiting and quite clearly being ignored\u002Foverlooked by staff. The most disappointing part was that their was a supervisor quite visible and active, walking back and forth behind the bar staff. What was upsetting was the \""supervisor \"" had seen us several times waiting and clearly being ignored. When I waved and caught his attention I asked if he was a supervisor he acknowledged he was. I commented that there seemed to be an issue with us being served,  he kinda smiled\u002F smirked ,turned and walked away. The incident was insulting, unprofessional but rather unimportant because we were not technically staying at that hotel but as we walked away it was quite unanimous that the incident was enough to make any of us not ever want to stay at that hotel.  It's one thing to have staff make preferential choices on whom  to serve but if a staff member in a supervisory\u002Fmanagement position chooses to discriminate on whom to serve then it definitely reflects on the image of the hotel. \nFor the reference,  we have stayed at about 50 resorts throughout Mexico.

Boy was I wrong and so delusional. \n\nDO YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED $ ON A BUSY PLACE WITH POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE? I've seen sewer rats run better motels than this dump. The customer service is an absolute joke. Don't go premium- you won't get treated any better. Here are some of the highlights of our trip:\n\n 90% of the staff does NOT speak English. Conversations are so hard.\n\nBartenders at the swim up bar will \uD83D\uDCAF  ignore your children. Rude and entitled, even when given a big tip. They give preference to the locals who speak Spanish. We felt extremely sad watching our kids from afar, politely waiting their turn, just to be ignored repeatedly. You need to train your staff better! A lady who special needs was waiting ages for a water. We went to ALL swim up bars and the staff is absolutely not friendly to foreigners.\n\nThe food- same old stuff daily, but the real offense is the disgusting pasta bar, uncooked pizza bottoms, and the suspicious tasting vegetarian food. The desserts are soooo bad. Stick to fresh fruit. Prepare yourself to spend HOURS on the toilet. Spoke to 3 other families, including a local one, with similar experiences. \n\nCharge charge charge- everywhere you go there is an extra charge. Extra charge for the pirate park, for the go-karts. You constantly have to carry your wallet around for the extra charges. \n\nOverall customer service: the premium lounge people are disappointing. We've had better service from premium\u002F elite services at 3 star hotels. Servers look unhappy, especially at the restaurants. Buffet cooks look mad! Can't even get a decent crepe without a burned side. Staff at the spa are decent. However, the treatments are not worth all the $. Staff at Barcy are friendly and good with kids. \n\n Restaurants: not worth it. Quality of food is not an upgrade from the buffet.\n\n Mall: RIP OFF. SUNSCREEN 125 ML OF NIVEA $55 USD.  Games at the bowling alley- will cost you a kidney for a few minutes of entertainment. Skating on a PLASTIC surface? Ha! Take your money, get a taxi, and go shopping outside the resort. \n\nRooms: we had the premium suite with a living room, dinette area, king bed, 1 outdoor and 1 indoor jacuzzi tub. Air conditioning wasn't working in room. Greeted on the first day by a massive cockroach in the first bathroom. If my experience in that room wasn't good, I don't dare to think about what others are experiencing in non-premium accommodations. Everyone deserves a clean environment and this wasn't it. \n\nMy advice? Not worth the $. Go to a less busy place with better customer care. Don't trust the food!

The lady at the front desk was not friendly at all. It was 3 of us (mom, dad, and a 6-year-old). They gave us a king bed; we requested two queens and they said they didn't have any available. Out of all the 4 other properties they had they did not give us a room with two beds. Are resorts booked up, yes, however I went online and saw they had two beds available. Why they didn't want to give us a room with two beds, I'm not sure. Furthermore, let me say, we had no problem paying the cost for a room with two beds we were just told no. \n\nAfter check in went straight to guest services to get reservations for dinner. The young lady that helps you make a reservation for the restaurants was rude & didn't bother to even check to see if they had any openings. We walked in and stayed we would like to see what options are available for the restaurants. Without even looking in the system, she told us everything was booked up. All four properties didn't have a single opening.  The next morning, we went back to guest services (same lady), stayed they didn't have any openings. We tried again little bit after 3 and was told they had one opening at 6:30 at one restaurant. As much as we wanted to explore the different restaurants, we also didn't want to keep running to guest services throughout the day for reservations, especially after the two encounters we had.  Again, we understand resorts are busy and get booked up, but it was still we only could get one opening out of the 5 days we were there. We tried the different buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and I can agree with other comments that the food is not the best. The one restaurant experience we had was nice and we wish we could've tried more restaurants over the buffet. \n\nThe rooms could be updated, but it's still a nice room. After one night in the room, we went back down to the front desk and try to get another room for several reasons. 1 the sink stopper and the tub stopper were not properly installed, the mirrors in the bathroom were not clean, the balcony area had bugs, and most importantly something was biting my child as well as myself almost every night. We would wake up each morning with marks from something biting us. We inform the front desk, and nothing was done. Again, if we wouldn't have lost out on so much money, we would've looked into staying elsewhere. Instead, we just make the room was thoroughly cleaned each day and made the best of the vacation.\n\nPools are huge and amazing, lots of activities, they a mini water park called Pirates Island, but my daughter loved the pool, so we didn't bother to pay the extra to go to Pirates Island. As much as we loved the pool, someone stole my daughters floaties while we were are doing an activity in the pool. Was it my fault for not keeping an extra eye on her floaties, yes. HOWEVER, it's a resort, it's clear everyone was securing chairs by the pool with their belongings and enjoying the pool. As much as I travel I have never to watch my items so closely with in the pool at a resort, especially floaties for a 6-year-old. \n\nOverall great resort, just wish we didn't have so many issues and was at least compensated in some way.

The staff are all amazing. The grounds are immaculate. This is in my opinion the best run of the 6 or so resorts I've been to. \n\n2.  We had a great time at all the restaurants and bars. At the Caribe pool bar, Daniel and Angel (and everyone else) were awesome! They had great energy and personalities, and kept everyone smiling and dancing. It was impressive to see them crank out drinks, while still managing to connect with people on a personal level and make everyone feel super welcome.  I have to say it's very impressive to see them, and other staff working in this hot humid area but always smiling and connecting with all the guests. Thanks guys!\n\nWe also spent a lot of time in the Caribe lobby bar, where we were also well attended to. Same thing at the Striker's Sports bar where Arturo and crew were smiling, and efficient making drinks.\n\n3. The rooms and restaurants were all cool. The A\u002FC worked great!  I can't express how nice this was. In other stays in the area this was not the case at all..\n\n4. The service at the Caribe buffet was great. We ended up having Daniel as our server multiple times.

Its an additional fee, but to us it was well worth it. The water was a little bit cooler than the other pools, which made it even better\n\n6. The little shops were great.

A few agoutis and birds were around.\n\nTurtles and tons of fish at the palace beach and by yhe pier. There was an enclosure with a bunch of their nests on the beach.\n\nIt was forecasted to rain most days, but usually cleared up or sometimes poured for less than an hour in the early afternoon.\n\nA little Spanish goes a long way, know the basics before you go for the best experience.\n\nWe don't generally have issues with food at AIs, we are pretty basic eaters, meat and potatoes... the buffets were tough. They added weird sh!t to everything. I'm sure more adventurous eaters would be fine. There wasn't a made to order pasta station at the buffets for dinner, which is usually my go to and the food rarely seemed hot. Omelet station was on point.\n\nSteakhouse (Santa fe) and Brazilian (Rodizo) were amazing a la carts for other meat and potato fans.\n\nCaribe candy buffet on Sunday night was fun.\n\n20-50 pesos in the fridge, with a list if what you want, worked every day.\n\nYou MUST order the pool floaties off of Amazon. It was so relaxing in the pool.\n\nBook a la carts when you check in, walk up if you don't get what you want, most people we talked to were let in\n\nMuch more international crowd then other AIs we've been to.\n\nThe Mayan mall has all your shopping needs, all kinds of shops and local vendors. Haggle with the vendors, save 20% with premium in the shops\n\nSunscreen is $90 US a bottle, I sh!t you not. Bring a pharmacy with you (aloe, Tylenol, advil, cold meds, allergy, first aide kit). Bring your own snorkel gear if you plan to snorkel, its by the hour if you rent free stuff there.\n\nMost on site stuff is cheaper if bought in advance. Spa is 40% off if you book in first 48 hr, dressel divers 20% two days before. Cenotes were cheaper booked online\n\nThe ceramic painting was a high light for all of us and about $25 each.\n\nI messaged the hotel over Facebook messenger and requested a king with the sofas made into beds and got it.\n\nWe had a swim up, so didn't use the pool or beach chairs often, but there always seemed to be lots of open ones at any location or time of day.\n\nLoved having insulated mugs for drinks and metal straws.\n\nOh, mini putt is free before 7pm.\n\nThey only had very large spoons. So bring small spoons if you need them.\n\nIf you like paper, salt, ketchup on the table, just ask your server.\n\nBring firestick if you like to chill in the room at all, not much for English TV outside of E!, History, CNN, sports, a few cartoon channels and HBO.

Plenty of games and activities throughout the resort during the day , but not as good as other all inclusive resorts. \nThe night entertainment is hit and miss, some very good, some very mediocre. \nThe drinks and food is very good, especially the alacarte.

We got out the airport at 11:30, waited 30 minutes for our shuttle bus to arrived. It\u2019s supposed to take 1:20 ride to the resort, but it took us 3 hours to get to our resort, because of traffic and dropping people at 4 different resorts before us. We were the last one to be dropped off. The good thing is, we got our room ready as soon as we arrived!\nI booked a premium room at the Caribe section ocean view, because I wanted a Jacuzzi on my balcony (a must for me). The ocean view was inexistent though. The room faces the ocean, but my room was without a sea view. I didn\u2019t really care, I just cared about my jacuzzi. It was working perfectly!!\nThe extra that was given for booking Premium room, is the terrace with a Jacuzzi, 1 hour per day\u002Fper person for hydrotherapy in the spa, just a fantastic experience! fast check in and check out. They will book all the \u201CA la carte restaurants for you\u201D. The snacks in that premium welcome room were really good, so fresh. The ladies were so helpful when I needed something. You do not need a card to get towels around the property. You get as many towels as you need daily. This resort provides a bracelet door key for your room. So, no need to carry around a plastic card key for your room. Your room can stay cool all day long. The air con worked like a charm.\nLooking at the ocean from a distance was a beautiful blue and turquoise color, but the beach was so disappointing. LOTS of seaweed and a mountain of it too !!!. Some areas you couldn\u2019t enter the water. It was truly nasty. The last 2 days, the beach between the Maya Caribe and Maya Beach was clear and stunning!!\nBeautiful resorts, so much to do, gorgeous theater with lots of seating with huge ceiling fans. It was so comfortable to watch a show at night, that I often fell asleep lol. Maybe because the shows start too late! 9:30 to 10:30. The magic show was my favorite. You must see the Spectacular show at our neighbor resort (Tropical-Colonial) The costumes are wonderful, amazing singers and excellent performers!! your kids will absolutely love it and you too. I used to be a big fan of Michael Jackson in his early days, this was not my favorite show at all. Bad make-up \u002F horrible wig and he lacked of energy. Sit far from the stage and maybe you will appreciate it!\n\nI loved to walk around the mall and the Mexicana market at night, it\u2019s expensive but very lively.\n\nLots of pool chairs to choose from at the Caribe pool. I\u2019m an early bird, so I got up around 6:00am the first morning, (reserved 3 long chairs for me, my husband and my son) and came back right after breakfast around 7:30. I saw lots of available chairs until 10am. The pools are huge, so you can easily float with your floaters without bumping into people.\nIf you are early birds, you can even get your coffee at the Sport bar \u201CStrikers\u201D located in the mall before 7am. Although they did not have a coffee shop, they had a self-serve industrial coffee maker accessible in every buffet restaurant around the resort. You can pour yourself a cup of tea\u002Fespresso\u002Fcappuccino\u002Fregular coffee\u002FMoka coffee\u002F hot chocolate. They also had a self-serve ice cream cone industrial machine. Loved it!!\n\nThe Caribe section is the best located resort out of all of them, especially if you got young kids. This resort was in the middle of everything!! The sport bar has arcades $, pool tables $, bowling $ Order activity around the property, Tennis\u002Fbasketball courtyard, mini golf (free before 7pm), if I\u2019m not mistaken! They have a Haunted house$, escape room$ (this is amazingly fun), FlowRider$, waterslides$, Casino$, Disco club (free and fun according to my son 22-year-old son) A Dolphin show (free to watch) but with a fee if you wish to swim with them. So much more!!!\n\nFood:\nThis was not good according to me, my husband, and my son, in all the evening buffet. I thought we would have better chance at the A La Carte restaurants, but I was not thrilled at all.\nI went to a Steak house, Japanese, and even booked a 20$USD per persons for the Brazilian restaurant at the Maya Palace. This was not horrible, but I did not feel satisfied with any of my meals. The 4 properties, (Beach, Caribe, Colonial, and Tropical) alternate theme nights, so they switch food between resorts, so it was never fresh, or the meat was never tender and it was dry.\n\nBreakfast was fabulous everytime though! Nothing negative to say!!! my favorite server YVAN was the best!!!! He made our morning shine bright!!!\nI loved the lunch type buffet at the Captain Morgan located near the beach. They cook meat right in front of you, pork, chicken, beef steak or beef burgers. Loved it!!!\nI always compare the food to 5 stars resort I previously stayed in. My taste is not yours, so don\u2019t be turned off by my comment. You will never go hungry. It\u2019s not horrible like Cuba, you will find something, and maybe say, wow it\u2019s the best food I ever eaten!!!! especially if it\u2019s your first time visiting Mexico.\n\nEntertainment by the pool, was non existent. I was chasing the pools between Beach\u002F Caribe\u002FColonial\u002FTropical to be entertainment for 2 days with no luck, so I stayed at the Caribe. If you love quiet by the pool, this resort is for you. You will only see action if you get groups of people being loud. I am more a pool person than a beach person, so for me, this is a must to be entertained. I used to be an entertainer for 30 years, so I come to be entertained in return. I only saw water aerobics at noon and bingo around 2pm for 3 days. I so wish I could have taken that mic and making it lively. The entertainers sounded like a plane pilot explaining the flight itinerary. I also saw 2 team members walking together around the pool 2 mornings only, with a bucket filled with items for a guessing game, but they never walked toward me and my family and or the people sitting close to us to ask to participate. Sadly, inexperienced team.\n\nTip for room: There\u2019s not too much walk from the lobby to the beach, so any room is walkable. If you wish to visit a neighbor resort, you can use their shuttle bus, that will drop you off at their front lobby.\nThe only thing is, there\u2019s only 1 elevator closer to the lobby but none near the pool\u002Fbeach, so if your room is on the top floor near the pool\u002Fbeach, you will need to walk up and down those stairs closer to your room or walk on the bottom floor to the other end to catch an elevator. I did use the stairs daily. Not a problem for me.\n\nNote: I got my silver earrings stolen from my room.\nI always tip the cleaning lady and the person who fill my fridge. This time, I didn\u2019t ask for my room to be made daily. I put a sign (Do Not disturb) for the first and second day, and by the second morning I said I will put a sign tomorrow to have my room made on the 3rd day, but they came during the second day, even though the sign (Do not disturb) was up, so obviously I was not ready for them and didn\u2019t have any tips. So, I left my sign up again for the next 2 days, but they did the same thing. Last evening, I left my earrings (925 silver, not expensive) near the sink, and I put on some cheap fashion earrings instead for the evening. When I came back, they were gone, the rest of the room was untouched though. Never bring any valuable jewelry or precious items to any resorts. So, I guess the made tip herself by taking my earrings.\nResorts don\u2019t do anything about stolen items in a room. They will say, we\u2019ll see what we can do! but they won\u2019t fired their employees, and they won\u2019t compensate you at all, so again, don\u2019t bring expensive stuff.\n\nOverall, I had a pleasant stay. I would probably be back and get the same room. This alone was worth the stay!!!",4,positive,"June 7, 2023",Carretera Chetumal-Puerto Juarez Km. 266.3,"('',)",Yucatan Peninsula,77750

I\u2019ve traveled from Cabo San Lucas, Puerto Vallarta, Cozumel, Cancun and everywhere in between. The Barcelo experience was by far our worst experience in Mexico we have had. We stayed in a premium junior suite. I didn\u2019t see any benefits to upgrading to premium.\n\nThe food was horrendous. I\u2019ve been to a variety of all inclusives and I\u2019m not a picky eater, but it was hard to find good food. I ended up getting most of my calories from desserts.\n\nIt was very difficult to get dinner reservations at the restaurants. I paid extra cash to guest services and magically got times scheduled. While at the restaurants they were literally only a quarter full. It was almost like they would rather their guests eat at the buffet to save on costs.\n\nThe dress code at the restaurants was the most amusing. I know there are always dress codes at the restaurants at all inclusives. I\u2019m always clean shaven, hair styled, in a dress shirt, dress shoes and dress shorts. This resort has a weird issue with shorts. No shorts allowed. I was being told I couldn\u2019t go into a restaurant because I was wearing dress shorts. As I\u2019m talking with the hostess, a man in a tee shirt, jeans with holes in them, and a baseball cap walked right in. I looked at the hostess and said he looks presentable? She said, well he\u2019s wearing pants. I changed into a pair of pants and was shocked to see the dress of most men in the restaurants. I saw men in beach T-shirt\u2019s, dirty ball caps, jeans, sweat pants, tennis shoes and one guy literally looked like he was getting ready to change someone\u2019s car oil.\n\nWe stayed in a junior suite premium room. I\u2019m not joking when I say I\u2019ve stayed at holiday inns that had better rooms. No way this place is 5 star. Maybe, just maybe a 4 star. The resort is huge, which I liked.\n\nThe service was hit or miss. Some employees were really good and others were horrible. I did not witness anyone going above and beyond like I\u2019ve experienced in my past Mexico trips.\n\nThe beach was probably the best part of the trip. There was a lot of room to sit and relax. I even swam next to a barracuda!\n\nAll said, I would never stay at a Barcelo resort again. I can\u2019t understand all the positive reviews on this resort. I cannot believe I was so unlucky to not experience what others have.\n\nI never write negative reviews, but I felt I had to in this situation.",1,negative,"August 10, 2023",Carretera Chetumal-Puerto Juarez Km. 266.3,"('',)",Yucatan Peninsula,77750

They have a synthetic ice hockey rink in the mall and right by the rink is a jewellery booth that has been strategically placed. They use a real puck and have no safety netting. The skates are garbage and it is more dangerous than skating on real ice. Of course the puck goes over the 4ft high only boards and of course this happens whilst we were playing on it. The puck was deflected over the boards and smashed somes glass at the jewellery booth. The manager (Christina Garcia) at the Caribe on duty was awful, they wouldn't let us see the waiver form we signed and told us that we had to pay $6,000 USD!! for the glass and that if we didn't cooperate she was going to call the police. It was obviously an accident, no one was harmed and the jewellery wasn't damaged, only the glass and we were willing to cooperate and very apologetic but that didn't seem to matter. It wasn't until we gave them our room number that they would finally let us see the waiver form. We had to fill out a statement signed with our room number. We were staying at the Tropical hotel part of the the Barcelo Maya Resorts. This carried over to our hotel where we dealt with the director of the Tropical (Viktor) who was more reasonable to deal with, however said that we had to pay $600 USD for the glass and said they had to get replacement glass from out of province which is why it was so much money. We want back the next day and the glass was already replaced and the guy that runs the booth said that this happens all the time... I explained this to Viktor and caught them in their lies. Fast forward to check out, they brought the price down to $200 USD and said if I didn't pay that they were NOT going to let me check out and make sure I miss my flight home this character at the checkout was (Carlos Ojeda) and was unreasonable and very threatening. The treatment and the way this was dealt with made it obvious they set this up a quick scam. I had to go down to front desk 4 times throughout the holiday to deal with Viktor twice of which he wasn't even there. It definitely tarnished the holiday and the moral of this story is don't play on the hockey rink in the mall at the Caribe at Barcelo Maya, \nOn top of this, one the kids in the group had accidentally broke a lamp, the parents were told it was $500 USD at checkout. When our plane landed back in Canada they actually ended up charging their credit card $4,000 USD!!. Shame on Barcelo Maya for this criminal activity.

We travelled from the UK with TUI ages 51,47 &19\nWe were lucky enough to spend 2 weeks in this fantastic hotel. We were in an ocean front premium room in the caribe section ( you can go to all its adjoining ones apart from AO and palace)it was lovely, very clean, and the beds were very comfortable. The shower was nice and powerful and also very clean. The air conditioning was a very welcome addition when you wanted to get out of the heat.\nAlthough we didn't use the pools again, they looked pretty good, but we much preferred the beach where there were plenty of sun beds to go around, yes there was seaweed but the staff work so hard trying to clean it away however it was only a couple of days that it was very noticeable please don't let this put you off going as its a truly beautiful spot.\nFood in the main buffet was the only letdown for us, and that was only because it wasn't very warm. There was a lot of variety, so something for all. All the staff were lovely here, but we impartially loved Saul and Santos in the main buffet. They went out of their way to make you feel welcome and would have great chats with us a real credit to your hotel. We also ate in the Italian restaurant and food here was divine, probably why we ate here 3 times over our stay loved the singing chefs. We also liked strikers perfect for a cold beer in the air conditioning. We went to 2 of the beach bars most days, Captain Morgan and the steakhouse grill one. I forget the name of that, but burgers were fantastic.\nThe grounds were absolutely immaculate and so pretty there is do much there to keep you entertained whatever your age we especially loved the mini golf we liked to do the if weather was a little off and loved the fact we were always joined by lizards. We also did one of the escape rooms. That was great fun. The entertainment in the evening is great too. Michael Jackson tribute and the circus were our favourites.\nWe booked a trip to snorkel with turtles and go to a cenote with the hotel. I definitely recommend it.\nPack your snorkel and sea shoes, as the coral is beautiful to swim over. we saw lots of pretty fish stingrays and a barracuda. Turtles tended to be opposite Palace Hotel.\nAll in all, we had an amazing time and would definitely recommend this hotel. So if you're thinking of booking here, just do it. You won't be disappointed, and when you get there, make sure you have a Miami Vice cocktail so nice.\n**Note to UK travellers especially if with TUI you will have no rep visiting the hotel you can only use the app which is a bit of a pain as time difference means you won't get answers straight away as we found out when we arrived and had a issue with our booking, as it was 7pm in Mexico it was 1am in the UK so it didn't get sorted till the next morning. This isn't the hotels fault. This is something I think TUI needs to look into changing.",5,positive,"June 28, 2023",Carretera Chetumal-Puerto Juarez Km. 266.3,"('',)",Yucatan Peninsula,77750

I have been all over the Caribbean for over 15 years, travelling at least once\u002Ftwice a season, so I've seen my fair share of all kinds of resorts.\n\nAs with all trips, there is the good and bad.\n\nThe Bad:\nI was originally booked for the Beach but was bumped to the Caribe for whatever reason and was told by the front desk \""When you book a hotel, there is NO guarantee you will be placed in that hotel.  It's all due to availability.\"".  I specifically wanted the Beach hotel because friends who had previously stayed at Barcelo recommended it.\n\nOver the course of my visit, I was put into three different rooms at the Caribe.\nThere was a very large group of kids from Peru that were disrespectful and noisy in the first building I was in.  Point to the booking staff: If you know a group like this is coming to your resort, put them ALL in one building and keep other guests in another building.\n\nAfter a few days of noise, I went to the front desk and requested another room in a different building.  They were happy to accommodate me and so I moved.  Then a few days later the front desk told me I HAD to move again because of a \""maintenance\"" issue with the room they just put me in. Couldn't you have checked the room out before putting me in it?\n\nThe last room I moved to was okay - no complaints.\n\nI am not impressed with the front desk manager for his total lack of compensation\u002Fconcern for my inconveniences. He was going to give me a bracelet to access the Palace, but in order to get this, I had to sign a waiver saying Barcelo is not responsible for anything that happened to me or will happen to me in the future (this was the kicker). So basically, if the next day the building fell in on me, they are not responsible? Ya right I'll sign it. Not.  Keep your wristband.\n\nAnd finally, they water down the drinks, without a doubt.  I'm a big tequila drinker and asked for a straight shot of Jose Cuervo.  It tasted like yellow water.\n\nThe good:\nThis resort is setup very well.  Being centrally located, it was easy for me to walk everywhere quickly.  On good days, the beach and the ocean were very nice, however you have to watch in certain areas as the sand is more gravel and rock.  And you have to keep an eye out for small sea urchins that if stepped on could ruin your vacation. About half the staff in all areas are very friendly, while others are just so-so and some are just generally miserable.  Such as life.  There was always something good to eat at the buffets, however I found that the morning buffets, in all hotels were disappointing.  Mostly the scrambled eggs were always watery, cold and barely edible and most other stuff on the menu was cold as well.  Good Mexican coffee though.\n\nMy favorites:\nDinner: La Trattoria Italian restaurant in the Mall.\nLunch: Captain Morgan's near the Caribe\nSnacks: Strikers Sports Bar in the Mall\nBuffet: They're all about the same and pretty good\nBar: Piano bar at the Colonial and Strikers\nBeach Area: Right in front of the Riviera\nEntertainment: Magic Show\u002FMichael Jackson\n\nOne tip: Spend the extra money and stay at the Riviera. It's new, modern and the pool\u002Fbeach\u002Frooms\u002Ffacilities are stunning. All other hotels are just mediocre and typical of Caribbean low budget resorts (i.e. don't expect too much if you do book the Beach, Caribe, Colonial, Tropical, Palace).\n\nThe main reason I chose the Barcelo was because of the scuba diving with Dressel Divers who are located onsite. I think that just because of them, I would chose to return to this resort complex. See my trip advisor review I gave them for further information.

The best thing about this is that you get to visit and use the amenities of their sister hotels. Our room was kept clean which we appreciate very much. Food was ok at the buffets -Colonial side has good coffee and breakfast while the Caribe side has better dinner options- but the staff makes up for it with great service!! I recommend you get your lunch at either Captain Morgan (great ceviche!) or the other restaurant on the other side of the beach (sorry I forgot the name) where they serve fresh whole fish (fried) and whole mangoes! The Italian restaurant Trattoria has good food for a sit down dinner. The beach was clean and we even saw a turtle and stingray on our last day there!! The spa was great! We had an 80 minute massage and it was heavenly!! Make sure you book this whitin 48hrs of your stay to get the 40% off. A little tip if you want to avail of the free water sport activities like catamaran ride, kayak etc. go there at 9am sharp coz it\u2019s stiff competition to get on the list. If they give you the vibe that they don\u2019t want to go out to the sun \uD83D\uDE02 you have to persevere coz it\u2019s worth it! Also, borrow a life vest, bring some bread crumbs, go to the dock and jump out!! There\u2019s a LOT of fishies hanging around there! It\u2019s also the best place to watch the sun rise.

All stays were great with no to minimal unwanted disruptions, with the exception of Caribe. Our stay at the Caribe was fueled with consistent and nagging issues with poor or no resolution. Below are the pros and cons of our stay:\n \nPros:\nAbility to upgrade your services to Premium for a more luxury stay.\nBeautiful lobby entrance, and available Premium level lounge and outdoor bar if you upgrade.\nClose proximity to the mall where you can dine, bowl, play video games, shop, a teen\u2019s night club (ages 13-17) and more.\nBoth buffets had friendly and promptly service, good assortment of food choices, and clean.\nHut with a pool table and ping pong table available by the pool.\nHalf of the beach entrance to the water was rock free and easy to enter. Other hotels have many rocks that you\u2019ll need to walk over to get to the smooth areas in the gulf.\nBeautiful pool with occasional activities offered by the staff(bingo, water exercises, water polo and more).\nThe resort was clearly manicured and maintained well. Walking through and observing the scenery and occasional wildlife making an appearance was pleasure.\nEvery day of the week they have a show in their auditorium which varies from traditional Mexican dancing, magic shows, Michael Jackson impersonator and karaoke.\nThey offer a red bus to take you between the different resorts for free.\nClose to Dolphinarium were you can observe, or pay, to swim with the dolphins.\nOffer free water sports (tricycle, kayake, wind sailing), and paid (jet skis, scuba diving) nearby.\n \nCons (Mostly Service Related):\nThere is typically only one person working the Premium desk for check-in\u002Fout, so waiting times could vary between 10 to 35 minutes. Sometimes going through the standard lobby desk would be quicker.\nUpon checking in the premium desk failed to provide us with simple instructions, such as, how to get to our room, and once entering the room we need to place our room key in a designated lot to active the electricity in our room.\nPremium level services offer free towel services without a towel card. We had to dispute this with the towel lady numerous times. We spoke to the supervisor Armando who stated that our black premium bracelets indicate we do not need towel service. Second day we encountered the same issue, with the same lady and explained we spoke to Armando, but still refused to provide towels to us.\nWe had to cancel a dinner reservation and called the premium desk to assist since they booked the reservation. We were told calling in would not suffice, and had to walk down to the premium desk to turn in our printed ticket with our reservation. That was an inconvenience so we didn\u2019t do it and questioned why that was necessary at all.\nWe requested water to be delivered to our room. Four hours later, nothing was delivered so we called again for water, and within 30 minutes 4 bottles of lukewarm water was delivered.\nRooms needs upgrading\nWi-Fi is not consistent when out by the pool or beach ",3,negative,"June 17, 2023",Carretera Chetumal-Puerto Juarez Km. 266.3,"('',)",Yucatan Peninsula,77750

The only negative experience was the gathering of Joe Dispenza's cult, there must have been over two thousand of them. They ruined our two days on the beach, because they were performing some kind of rituals, emitting screams, sick movements, it was very scary. I understand that it's about making money, but the resort has guests even without them. I have video footage to prove this.\n\nNow let's get down to the good stuff:\n\nRooms:\nThey should be renovated, especially the bathrooms, tiles. Upon entering the room, the bedding was damaged and stained, but they replaced it immediately. In general, the cleanliness of the room was very satisfactory during the vacation. Don't take seriously what they write about bugs or I don't know what. it often happens that the cards for entering the room stop working, and you have to go to the reception, which is not very close. Most of the rooms need to be renovated.\n\nFood:\nThe breakfast is phenomenal, varied, delicious, especially outside by the pool. A huge selection of food, fruit, squeezed juices, ice cream, drinks, coffee especially from espresso machines. The hygiene is excellent, and the staff is very kind. As for lunch, also a serious choice of food, but mostly we couldn't eat anything but fruit, because we overeat at breakfast. For dinner we used a la carte, Mexican, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, steak, only in the Mexican restaurant the food was not at the level of the a la carte restaurant (a little disappointment because the Mexican restaurant in Barcelo Bavaro Palace was excellent). Drinks at the pool bar in a huge selection, no complaints.\n\nBeach:\n\nThe beach in front of Beach and Caribe sections, nicer for entering and swimming, but in front of Palace and Tropical, better for snorkelling, you can see dozens of different fish, rays, sea urchins, as well as swim with turtles, an extremely unforgettable experience.\n\nIt should be noted that there is a huge number of entertainment facilities in the hotel, two theatres with excellent programs, a sports cafe, a disco, bars... You also have a local market where you can buy souvenirs at reasonable prices, unlike hotel stores. You simply don't have enough days for all that, and be prepared to walk 10 kilometres every day, inside the resort.\n\nIt is recommended to organize cheap transportation to the downtown of Cancun and back, because taxis are too expensive and there is no other transportation.\n\nWe will certainly return to the Barcelo Maya Grand Resort again, but please renovate the rooms, and without gathering sects and cults, this is still a family resort. I will give you 5 stars because of all the above, staff, food, location, nature, beach, service, but because of the inconvenience with the Dispenza cult, I should have given you a 1.",5,positive,"August 8, 2023",Carretera Chetumal-Puerto Juarez Km. 266.3,"('',)",Yucatan Peninsula,77750

Not only is the resort absolutely beautiful, we always feel very safe. Shaquille ,the security guard  is so sweet and keeps an eye on everything. Jimmy and Jamie  and the entire staff start to feel like family after a few weeks.  It is convenient to the grocery store and shops and you never have to fight for and umbrella on the very private beach.

A beach comprised of fine white sand, so what do they call this beautiful land?  West Indies was its name of old, where many seafaring tales were told.  Now Grand Cayman has become a popular destination, where you can enjoy a relaxing vacation.  So if this all sounds like a good spot to play, The Caribbean Club is the best place to stay.

As our kids have gotten older, we now look for something bigger than a standard hotel room.   Sometimes that means we have to sacrifice all the \""bells and whistles\"" that come with a luxury resort in order to get the space that we need.    What I absolutely LOVE about the Caribbean club is that you get the best of both worlds!  \nThe condo's are absolutely stunning!  Really, the nicest I have seen.  At 2500 square feet, our three bedroom, three bath condo was more than enough room for the five of us.  Immaculate, top of the line appliances, bathrooms, and decor, and just so much space (see my pics)!   All rooms face the ocean with incredible balconies and views.  The resort is comprised of \""tower\"" rooms (where we were) and villa rooms.  I had a chance to tour a villa room while visiting and while they are closer to the ocean and the balconies on the oceanfront villa's cannot be beat, I would not hesitate to stay in either the tower or villa's on returning trips.  \nIn addition to fantastic space, the Caribbean Club gives you all the amenities of a full service resort including: daily housekeeping (truly the best housekeeping we've ever had and so accomodating to our crazy schedules), concierge services (I wanted to change dinner reservations several times and they always offered to do it for me to save me the local call fee), room service, drink and food service by the pool and on the beach, and one of the most popular restaurants on the island.  \nWhat I also loved about this resort is the beach.  The stretch of beach in front of the Caribbean club is wide and quiet.  They have these beautiful tiki huts for shade as well as incredibly comfortable loungers with thick padding and great towels.  We walked up and down the beach many times during our stay.  While the big resorts are great for their constant activities and water sports, I was so happy we did not have to fight for a chair or  shade, and were not right on top of the person next to us.  If peace and quiet on the beach is what you are looking for, this is the place for you.  \nAlso loved that the resort is directly across the street from a shopping center which houses a huge supermarket, liquore store, and breakfast\u002Fcoffee restaurant.  We did our own grocery shopping but if you like, the resort will do it for you before you arrive.   It is also within walking distance of several popular restaurants.  We rented a car just because we like the freedom of having one but truly you would not need to.  If you do rent a car, there is free parking in the garage underneath the hotel.  \nSeven mile beach is beautiful.  We were in Turks and Caicos last year at the same time and I have to say that they are very comparable beaches, especially from midpoint Seven mile up to the North end where the beach is wider.  There is so much to do: snorkeling,Stingray City, watersports, dolphins, turtle farm, shopping in town and at Camana Bay that you can easily fill a week (or two).

We enjoyed making breakfasts and some lunches in the full kitchen.  We travel extensively as a family and also often to the Caribbean. I would consider this a 4 star property.

We had a couple dinners and the sunday brunch and were very pleased overall.  I think CC is a great choice for families on GC and a great value if you are considering staying at some of the onsiderably higher priced nearby 5 star properties.

The facilities are absolutely beautiful, and the view from our room was STUNNING!  We stayed in a three bedroom unity and had more than enough space for our family of 5.  We didn't use the kitchen much as we weren't there that long; however, when we (hopefully) return, we will stay longer and plan to cook breakfast.  The rooms were spacious and beautiful, each with a ceiling fan, and the master connected to the balcony.  The balcony, with its loungers, was my favorite part - the perfect place to sprawl out with a book and a glass of wine after a long day at the beach.  \n\nThere is a grocery store nearby - it is walkable but a little bit of a trek (my husband and I had no problem doing it on our own, but it would have been tricky with the kids); however, you can order your groceries in advance through the hotel.  I HIGHLY recommend doing this!  There is also a liquor store across the street - super convenient!  \n\nWe ate at LUCA a couple of times - great service and great food!  We also ate at Tillie's (a short walk down the beach) for breakfast and dinner - the view there is amazing - you could not be closer to the ocean! - and the food and service was great.  For comparison, we also ate dinner at Saint June at the Ritz and found the food FAR better at Tillie's and LUCA, and the price was better as well.  \n\nWe snorkeled right off the shore with the kids.  At first, it seemed there wasn't much to see, but soon learned that the trick was to go out a bit farther - probably about 100 ft or so off show, past the buoys to where the water appears a bit darker.  From there, we saw numerous types of fish (grouper, snapper, parrot fish), we saw an eel, several sea turtles, and some squid.  My son (12 years old and a great swimmer) loved it!  It was a bit far out for my girls (7 and 8), but they were content snorkeling closer in and looking at smaller fish.\n\nWe took a charter out to Stingray City - Ezona's Charter (we would HIGHLY recommend) and had a great day there!\n\nThe only downside we found was (with a handful of exceptions) the service at the hotel.  There was never any one at the front desk - to get service I had to call out to see if anyone was there each time.  The front desk arranged the charter, and told me they had arranged for a taxi to pick us up at 8:50 for our 9 am charter.  In fact, there was no taxi.  We waited the next morning, but no taxi came.  The man working at the front, also thinking one had been arranged by the hotel, did not call for one until it was past 9, at which point we were late for the charter.  All in all, we missed nearly 30 minutes of our charter, and were unable to visit Starfish Point - where my girls were most excited to go.   Of course, the cost of the charter was the same.  \n\nIt was possible to get drinks\u002Ffood on the pool and beach, but it was nearly impossible to get any service.  Our last day of the trip was the only day anyone actually came by to ask us if we wanted anything.  It was also the only time anyone returned later to see if we wanted another drink.  Every other day we had to ask the man working on the beach with the towels and chairs - who was amazing by the way!  he was super attentive and quick to get us a great spot every day, AND would find us a server when we needed a drink - and only then would someone come by to take our drink order.  It would take quite some time for the drink to come (and the beach was quite empty - a HUGE plus in our opinion) and then we were lucky if we ever saw the server again.\n\nNeedless to say, with the exception of the man working the chairs at the beach, and also the housekeeping service (she was lovely), the service at this hotel was not what I would have expected for a 5-star resort.  That being said, the grounds, the room, the beach, the location, the restaurants - everything else was so incredibly perfect and beautiful (and also the ease by which you can simply get your own drinks and bring a cooler down with you truly minimizes the downside) that the positive FAR outweigh the negative in my opinion.  We would love to return to this spot, and, in fact, could not imagine staying anywhere else on Seven Mile Beach.  Some of the other high rated hotels (the Ritz for example), seemed so much more crowded - rows and rows of chairs on the beach with nowhere to walk - and did not offer the large, spacious suite option that we found here (we had looked at getting two rooms at the Ritz and chose this on instead).  Not to mention the restaurant was better here too!  \n\nWe cannot wait to return, and would highly recommend this spot - particularly for families!",5,positive,"June 23, 2023",871 West Bay Road,"('Seven Mile Beach',)",,KY1-1200

Even though we are both retired, she works so hard each and every day she never really gets to have any time of her own. \n\nWanting to find that really special place of tropical peace and tranquility, I started researching in late summer of '22. After a  month of searching, In October, I came across the reviews for Caribbean Club. \n\nThere are literally thousands of beaches in the Caribbean but, where is the one that has it all? Great weather, calm crystal clear water, beautiful sunsets, and a hotel with great food and staff that makes your every wish come true. \n\nThe Trip Advisor reviews help me find Caribbean Club, Grand Cayman.\n\nBy mid October I was talking with Danielle, manager who, I did not know at this time, would be retiring in January. I was woking to set something up for April '23. I told her it was to be a very special anniversary surprise for my wife. Could the restaurant set up a table on the beach one night, at sunset. Of course, she said and put me in touch with Jenny, at Luca, the restaurant for further particulars. I told Jenny I would like to have  one long stem red rose at the table and I also let her know what my wife's favorite main course and sides would be and she said no problem. Then I said my wife's favorite desert is german chocolate cake and she said it was not on the menu but she would have the desert chief bake a small one. Wow!\n\nAnd that's how everything went. On the night of the surprise dinner on the beach at sunset, we had our own personal waiter who was always stationed about fifteen feet away, on the beach ready to get anything we asked for. They added lit Tiki torches and a few lighted rocks in the sand around the table to add to the ambiance.It was very romantic. \n\nLittle did I know until we arrived, we had been upgraded to a three bedroom on the fourth floor complete with full kitchen, washer and dryer and full balcony with straight on views of the beach, crystal clear blue, green, turquoise water and sunsets.\n\nI had also arranged with Jaime (who replaced Danielle as manager when she retired) for a couples massage on one of our afternoons. What I found particularly nice is you don't have to go to the spa for the massage. The therapists bring massage tables to the room so you don't have to go anywhere and can afterwards retire to the balcony and further relax with your favorite beverage on the thickly cushioned lounges. \n\nThe beach as this boutique hotel is wide and spacious and Shorty makes sure you have your fully cushioned lounge under an umbrella or Tiki hut whenever you decide to hit the beach. The pool is very nice but we opted for the beach and warm water. Whenever we weren't in the water, all you had to do is raise your hand and someone would be there to bring whatever food and drink you wanted. \n\nWe ate often at Luca, but did also find more than a dozen other places to eat across he street and within a five minute walk. We did the brunch on Sunday at Luca and the food, drink and wine varieties seemed endless. \n\nWhile we chose to relax mainly at the hotel, the island offers many other attractions such as snorkeling, fishing, a visit to Sting Ray City, jet ski, and sailing. \n\nIf you want to go a bit out of walking distance, save money and take the bus instead of a cab. Yellow and green numbers 1 and 2 come along every two to three minutes and go up and down Seven Mile Beach and cost $2 each Cayman and $2.50 US. The purple number 3 goes back and forth to the airport about every 15 to 30 minutes. I spent $36 total for my wife and I from the airport not knowing we could have done it for $5 US. And there is no problem carrying your luggage aboard the bus. \n\nEvery staff member in the hotel or restaurant does an amazing job. Anytime called or asked for anything, it was done right now, not in a little while or as soon as someone could get to it. The crew has got it together. \n\nA great big THANK YOU to everyone who helped make our tenth anniversary a smashing success. Thanks you Danielle, Jaime, Jenny, Shorty, Matteo, Allison, Hira, Thai and the many others whose names I did not get or forgot. \n\nYou are an amazing team in an amazing place and my wife and I are working to figure out how soon we can get back there.

Covid got in the way and we had to re-schedule on several occasions and ultimately the logistics of getting everyone together from different parts of the world was too challenging and we asked to downsize to a suite for 2, which we finally did now in November 2022.\n\nHence our surprise that we were allocated the same 3-bedroom suite on the top floor of the main building, which although way too big for the two of us, was fantastic. The quality of everything in the suite is apparent, including the fully equipped kitchen, where glasses and cutlery are by Villeroy and Boch as an example. Beds, furniture, patio recliners etc. are all really comfortable and there is no lack of space to relax and enjoy. The view over seven-mile beach and out to sea is wonderful.\n\nThis part of the beach is not too crowded, and the limited number of guests \u002F residents meant that the Club\u2019s part of the beach was never overly busy. The recliners here also had nice thick cushions and were comfortable to spend a day on the beach. F&B is available from Luca, or many self-cater from their suites. The infinity pool is a nice size and a great location to relax and look out to sea.\n \nDespite the fact that we had a fully equipped kitchen, we were on vacation and didn\u2019t have the intention to self-cater. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and were advised in advance that grocery stores would be closed on Sunday, but we could pre-order groceries. We enquired as to breakfast possibilities and were told we could have breakfast at Luca, so we decided against ordering any groceries. Upon arrival we learned that there was brunch on Sundays, so no breakfast and that Luca\u2019s was closed on Mondays, so essentially we had no breakfast option for the first two days. On the Sunday we went out locally for breakfast and on Monday we were able to order in. For the remainder of the week we did breakfast at Luca, which was good quality but hardly frequented by other guests.\n\nHaving seen some of the larger hotel properties along seven-mile beach and hearing from taxi drivers that some take \u201Cday beach guests\u201D from cruise ships, we were very happy to have chosen Caribbean Club, even though it is somewhat more geared up to self-catering than a larger hotel would be.

I think they are mostly or all 3 BR's with 3 BA, and a large living space, kitchenette, and outside deck space.  I mean they are lovely to lounge in for breakfast, at lunch, and in the evening.  The views are great from most of the rooms, and I would go back just for the room and location.  Location is also very good, as we walked to dinner every night - with  seemingly a dozen good options within a half mile or so.  The beach is also great and not very crowded at all - always easy to get chairs either at the beach or the pool and everything is relatively close together so you could park in one space and go to the other or vice versa.  Relatively quiet, although with a lot of kids (including ours) and laid back.  For all these reasons I would definitely come back.\n\nSo why not 5 stars?  A lot nit-picky stuff, some of which you can see in recent reviews.  For example our ice maker did not work and the refrigerator was not cold enough.  Not huge deals, but little nuisances.  Several times we had to ask for extra towels during the week - we had 7 people (3 kids) in a 3 BR, and they would only leave 6 towels, when we needed 7 or 8.  The pool food was ok but not great.  There were not always enough beach towels ready immediately (though they would bring them to you when they were ready).  There was no fan in our master bathroom so a shower made the room steam up.  A few of the people were really very friendly, but a few of them weren't.  These are all small issues, but when put together enough for me to knock it down a notch.\n\nAll in all - it is a wonderful place to stay and I would not hesitate to go back.

My husband and I have travelled here with our 3 kids (aged 7, 9, 11) for the past 3 years.  The experience just keeps getting better!\n\nC-Club was originally recommended to us by friends who live in Cayman.  Like us, they love a great hotel and we trusted their \""insider advice\"" to chose C-Club over the Ritz.  The Ritz is beautiful and their service is exceptional.  We visit the Ritz restaurants or spa each time we are in Cayman....but we have never for a moment regretted not staying at the Ritz.  \n\nWe have come to LOVE the peace and luxury of C-Club.  The units are huge and done to a very high standard.  The patios are spacious and nicely furnished.  On each of our visits we have chosen to stay on the first floor -- it's so convenient with the kids.  Our last two visits, we have splurged on the ocean front units.  They are expensive!  But worth every penny to live right on the beach.  It is so quiet and serene that we feel we have a private slice of Seven Mile Beach.  Even the rich and famous couldn't live better than this!  The Ritz simply has nothing to compare to this experience.\n\nAll the little touches make C-Club heavenly.  First and foremost, Danielle and her staff are top-notch!  They are professional, capable, and truly interested in making your stay perfect.  Whether that means organizing grocery shopping, babysitting, sight-seeing, taxis....they do it with a smile!  The housekeeping staff are out of this world.  They actually CLEAN the unit every day and they even do the dishes!!\n\nThe pool area is well stocked with fantastic water toys for the kids.  And there is snorkelling gear at the front desk if you don't have your own (we do).  Ahhhhh...the snorkelling.  At C-Club you can slip into the turquoise water and in minutes be swimming with stunning tropical fish and sea turtles.  Our whole family spends hours in the ocean each day.\n\nIf snorkelling is not your thing, the pool is great.  Or you can arrange a pick up right on the beach for any kind on water adventure -  parasailing, private boat tours, sea-doo tours.....and the C-Club staff will hook you up with only the very best.  Or you can golf, mini-golf, visit local atractions.....\n\nIf you don't want to cook every meal in your gourmet kitchen, there are countless fabulous restaurants that you can walk to on the beach-side or road-side.  Or, you can simply walk a few yards to Luca, the onsite restaurant which will also provide poolside or room service.

During our 8 night stay all we saw was families with TONS of little kids, with 5-8 people to a party\u002Fsuite. You'd definitely save TONS of money staying here vs a hotel of comparable standards\u002Fthe Ritz Carlton a few doors down... But we are just a couple...so here is our review from \""our\"" point of view.\n\nWe arranged everything 3 months in advance via email with Elena and she was always prompt with getting back to us and answering questions. She offered us a \""meet and greet\"" which was $150 and totally worth it. As soon as we got off the plane an airport worker greeted us and whisked us thru immigration and customs and to our driver outside (10 mins max from deplaning to car). Our driver ($200 R\u002FT) had us to the CC within 15 mins and we were checked in and in our suite in 10 mins. (Thanks Elena).\n\nWe were given suite 504 in the tower section which has 3 bedrooms, 3 baths, corner suite with tons of windows, huge balcony w\u002F 2 seating areas and approx. 2700SF. The d\u00E9cor is island chic  and stocked kitchen for those who like to cook. The master bed is comfy. Tons of english channels on the living room TV, great for watching the NHL playoffs and MLB games after coming back from dinner each night. \n\nSo onto the \""cons\"" for us: The pool and beach service was terrible, I mean the worst I've experienced at this level hotel. We maybe saw the 1 pool\u002Fbeach server 1-2x a day, she\u002Fhe covered the pool and entire beach area plus was a busboy inside at Luca, so I understand why it was so slow. Why can't Caribbean Club hire 2 full time servers to serve their guests? We saved a substantial amount of money we usually spend by the pool\u002Fbeach during a vacation on drinks. We hated having to dry off, go up to the room, make drinks and carry them down to the beach (15-20 min process each time) but it was still faster than their beach service. This person could also help with towels and chair set-up in the mornings...instead of having to do that also ourselves. This may sound petty but come-on...I am not paying to be on vacation to serve myself.\n\nThe lobby is small with seating maybe for 2-3 people, its nice to have a large lobby with separate seating areas where you can have a before\u002Fafter dinner drink, listen to live local music and relax and talk. Also a concierge to help with dinner reservations, planned activities, etc.. we encountered 6 CC workers over our 8 nights at\u002Fnear the desk and all but Elena had their head in a book, texting, on cell, talking to other workers, whatever but never talked to us or ever mentioned us by last name. They weren't rude, just indifferent... \n\nCaribbean Club advertises itself as a \""Boutique Hotel\"" but we thinks its more of a \""Glorified Condo\"". There really is no service anywhere. We think people confuse \""friendly\"" with good service. The gym is adequate with no bottled water. No SPA. Only 1 restaurant. Turn down service consists of the bed turned down with 3 small snickers bars on the bed table (no exchange of towels, or light freshen up). \n\nWill we be back...sure if we bring our families...otherwise we'll see you at the Ritz. \n\nP.S. Fosters Food Store is diagonal from the hotel. They are full service deli, bakery, fish, meats, all grocery types...We did not cook at all but purchased snacks and went to Blackbeards (same plaza) a liquor store that has everything from cheap to fine wines and all your liquors and cases of beer. \n\nRestaurants:  Edoardo's is 5 min walk and fabulous, Luca onsite is amazing, and of course any of the restaurants at the Ritz is fabulous.",4,positive,"May 10, 2014",871 West Bay Road,"('Seven Mile Beach',)",,KY1-1200

The beach is rocky but the water is lovely.  There were a few glitches in the reservation so I would caution you to double check your confirmation.

When we got there we were told that we share power and water with another site which I would have been fine with but the hook ups were right in our site. It would have been better to have it centered between the sites as the other site was pretty far away and they would need extensions to even be able to hook up. 2 different groups stayed beside us and couldn't use the water or power for their RV due to this. The fact that the sites are so close is a good and bad thing.  For us it was bad because while we were there there was a huge group camping together and they were very loud all day and late into the night.  The quiet time was never enforced so if you're there for a family reunion or other big gathering it definitely is a good choice, but if you're not part of the group it can get a little annoying at times.  The facilities were clean but seemed a little run down,  it reminded me more of a provincial park than a privately run resort.

Serviced by an amazingly attentive older couple and their family, Ponderosa sits on the south shore of Canim Lake surrounded by tall trees and endless sky. There is electricity and water for the RV's with a dump station on site. The cabins feature two bedrooms and an extra large living room that could sleep 6 comfortably. Cabin two is especially nice with a covered porch that extends the width of the cabin looking out across the lake. Only 40 minutes into 100 Mile House, there is are two small grocery stores about 5 and 10 minutes west of the resort for the food basics, beer and liquor.

We found the service and overall caring of the owner ( older German couple)to be rude and just dry but didn't make a deal of it as we were in our RV doing our own things. We came back there yesterday and decided to book 2 nights in their little apartments they also have on site. Cost $238 for 2 nights. First surprise is that the place does not provide towels. We were told by the lady that it was clearly indicated on their Web site .... but she eventually gave us few towels. The second surprise was when we walked in the apartment.... rated from the 80's, smelly, spiders and spider webs all over the place. My wife and I looked at each other speechless and immediately regreted and thought : what did we get into. It was late and we turned the TV on and watched 2 Broke Girls (Photo attached). The place was cold as they'd just turned the heat on. The bed had no sheets, only a smaller quilt and two pillows so I went to the office and asked the lady for extra sheets and pillows. She looked at me literally insulted and said \""isn't there enough in there already ?\"" \"" You know you can turn the heat on more\"" .... Really ??? \nI went back to the office later in an attempt to get the wifi password and figure out how the TV works. We were the only ones in the entire resort that night and they turned all of their office lights off at 20:30 to make sure we were not going to disturb them further. \nWorst sleep ever, so we decided to not stay the second night and spoke with the male owner at 7:30 the next morning and informed him of our decision not to stay and asked for a credit. \""Nope!, you paid for 2 night and it is it!\"" \""Not our problem\"". \""The Web site clearly states 2 nights minimum and no refund\"". Really ??? \nSo we left a bit upset, and went to 100 Mile House and rented out night at the Ramada for another $128 which also had a kitchenette and proper matching bedding and supplies, free WiFi, breakfast and fresh smell. \nI recommend you stay in one of the many hotels in 100 Mile House when in the area and absolutely avoid the Ponderosa Resort as this old couple should perhaps just learn how to treat their customers with respect.",1,negative,"September 30, 2016",7405 Canim Lake Rd.

I loved everything about it...the drinks, the pool, the beach, the waterpark...both kids and adults. \n\nThe food was 3.5 out of 5 for me just because I was expecting a bit more at the buffet...like sushi, shrimp (only saw shrimp one day for dinner). But i still was able to eat more than I should and enjoyed it. \n\nThe only issues I had was with my room itself\n- upon check in there were bath towels in they room. But the next day housekeeping took them and never put clean ones. For the entire duration after that we received NO towels and had to go down to reception and take towels from the changing room. \n\n- the room while it appeared clean it was filthy under the bed filled with tonnes on dust and someone's sock. That really grossed me out. \n\n- no replacement of shampoo\u002Fconditioner\u002Flotion during my stay\n\n- the porch was never cleaned, some sand fell from our wet beach clothes and that just stayed on the floor for our entire stay. \n\nThe resort is a smaller resort which I liked.

With subpar hygiene, safety, and hospitality, it feels more like a budget hotel than a luxury all-inclusive resort.\n\nCheck-in:\nOur check-in experience was mixed. Despite booking directly with Corendon, we were not recognized as Gold Members and did not receive the promised benefits, even after showing proof. The check-in process was quick, but we initially received the wrong room keys. Our specific room requests (quiet room, baby bed pre-arranged) were ignored, which was quite disappointing.\n\nRoom:\nThe room was modern and well furnished, with a comfortable bed. However, the air conditioning system left much to be desired as it consistently left me feeling congested.\n\nAll-Inclusive Package:\nThe food was flavorful but lacked finesse. The BBQ restaurant was a standout, despite a static menu. Breakfast was basic, with poor-quality coffee and watered-down juice. All-day dining consisted mainly of fast food items with little variation. The cocktails were too strong and had a chemically sweet taste, owing to the use of artificial juice. However, the smoothies were excellent.\n\nEntertainment:\nSadly, entertainment was virtually non-existent. The children's disco was poorly managed, with the entertainer showing little interest and wrapping up after only 10 minutes. The resort could significantly improve with an enthusiastic and engaging entertainment staff.\n\nPools and Slides:\nWhile the pools were disappointingly dirty, the slide area was a hit and provided a lot of fun, even for our baby.\n\nStaff:\nThe staff was lackluster, appearing disinterested and inhospitable. Service was slow, and there was often a shortage of clean plates and glasses. A particular staff member, Gracy, seemed to have no interest in her job. An incident of a staff member working while wearing an AirPod was a prime example of the overall lack of professionalism. However, there were exceptions, particularly the staff at the slides and Radjoe, who ensured quick service at breakfast.\n\nHygiene and Safety:\nThis was a significant area of concern. The hallways and lighting fixtures were dusty, and the pool water was so murky that one couldn't see their own feet. Additionally, there were safety concerns with no lifeguards on duty and loose tiles around the children's swimming area, posing a serious risk for accidents.\n\nRenovations\u002FWork:\nSeveral renovation works were ongoing during our stay without prior notification. We were unable to use the Italian restaurant, and our request for a quiet room was disregarded as we were placed opposite construction work for a new hotel. The noise was constant, even throughout the night, which was frustrating, especially with a baby.\n\nOverall:\nThe resort has potential and could be a perfect vacation spot if you manage to secure a good deal. However, those accustomed to Hilton standards may be disappointed. With improvements in hospitality, variety in food offerings, and a more premium drink selection, this could become a great resort. For now, it falls short of expectations.",3,negative,"July 24, 2023",Pater Eeuwensweg 31,"('Willemstad',)",,

First off, the food was the exact same food all week. Dinner was called international night every night, and there was nothing new on the buffet. The \""restaurants\"" are not restaurants they are food stations with pre selected meals, no menus or options, and the food is the exact same every night. They tell you to use their app to make reservations for the restaurants. The app doesn't work, so you have to stand in line for over an hour to make reservations. Then they lost our dinner reservation after we stood in line for an hour to make it in person, and their solution was their exact words \""we can set a table out here in the direct sun and serve you\"". Breakfast was the exact same every day. We opted to go off resort multiple times to eat, including breakfast, even though we paid for an all-inclusive package. \n      We had housekeeping clean our room one day the whole trip, and they left us with no clean towels, bath mat, or washcloths but took all the dirty ones. \n      There were no shows or activities going on.

We arrived and the staff was very friendly. Bon Bini! Tanja was very helpful and answered all of our questions.

I know Curacao is supposed to be very safe but it was a little uncomfortable having to walk alone to a completely different building and some drunk guys did follow us more than once. Not the hotel's fault though. The rooms need MAJOR updating. There was peeling paint and mold in higher corners in the bathrooms. Neither of our soap pumps worked which struck me as odd during the times of COVID. There was hair on the soap pump in the shower. Gross. The room was supposed to have 2 king beds. One bed was 2 twin beds pushed together with nothing to keep the beds together so it was really sleeping on a twin bed or risk getting hurt. Housekeeping keyed in without knocking twice. I was naked both times. Then they didnt just leave when they realized people were in the room. There was no iron in the room either. The mini bar stayed well stocked.  The food during breakfast was good. Basic but good. The food during dinner was a lot of the same thing every night. Even though the sign would read \""Asian Night\"" or \""International Night\"" it would always be the same food. The swim up bar service (Coco Beach Bar) was abysmal.

The grounds, the pools, the beach, its just like a post card, amazing. The food is resort food so its the typical same things. One night they had amazing oxtails and the other really good shrimp but its resort food. \n\nWe really enjoyed our trip, however, this place needs to be under better management. Every morning at the buffet, they run out of coffee cups so people are forced to use the water\u002Fjuice glasses for their hot beverages. Now this causes the glasses to crack since its not meant for such hot items. My daughter was having juice in one of the glasses and it shattered in her hands cutting her on three places on her legs and her hand. The staff were quick to get us a first aid kit but no manager came out or anything as my 7 year old cried in pain.  That same night at the buffet, my husband pointed out my water glass had a huge crack it in. They need more staff to clean the tables and do a quicker turn around on the dishes. This is a smaller resort, they didn't have anyone taking drink orders at the buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner , you get the items yourself, which isn't a big deal.   The entertainment in the evening was enjoyable, however, they don't have enough chairs and tables for folks and you end up going down the beach to bring over tables and chairs that's near the beach bar ( which is close during this time.)  It would make sense that during the entertainment in the evening, staff would move all the tables and chairs to the entertainment space instead of having guest do it. On our last night they moved the entertainment to the beach  bar area without any posting.  The beach bar had maybe 5 tables and chairs so guests were once again forced to get their own chairs from the other side pool area.  Also, they did not space the events out properly so you're sitting there for 45 minutes with nothing to do. This is what I meant that they need better management. Curacao is beautiful and the resort pool, bars and beach are all amazing, but they truly need folks with more experience to run it. They are also doing construction next door to expand the hotel so I do hope the company read these reviews and make the changes. \n\nThe hotel is about 15 minutes walk to the town which is also a must see.  Everyone were really nice and the island is just beautiful. They have a 24\u002F7 snack bar with coffee, alcoholic drinks, teas, pastries and sandwiches which was a bonus to grab a snack after a long day at the pool and beach. There's also a smoothie bar where you can also get liquor in your smoothies and frozen coffee drinks. There are no blenders at the pool or beach bars.  They have a  waterslide area which the kids and adults loved.  I appreciate that they cater to families with kids so they would never be bored. There's a cute swing in the ocean which everyone loved and great for pictures.  The water at the beach is pretty deep so be careful if you're not a good swimmer.  Overall, we had a great time and I would return here but they just need better management.  They are expanding next door so I do hope they read the reviews and make the changes since this island is truly a must see.",4,positive,"July 23, 2023",Pater Eeuwensweg 31,"('Willemstad',)",,

We had a nice time! \nOverall, it was a solid experience.  I hope traveler's will read b\u002Fc I've taken time to write an honest review to educate 1st-timers as to what they can expect. :)\n*Room: We stayed in the king-size rm with partial ocean view. Our room faced pool (#2227). Very nice room decor, clean. We did have an issue re: the large shower head didn't work properly (my husband is following up w\u002FHilton as we're Diamond Club members & expect all amenities to be in workin\ng order. It was a bit frustrating not to be able to enjoy a hot shower under the full head after beach hopping all day). Cleaning service was great, water bottles daily, etc. Bed\u002Fpillows were really comfy!\n*Food\u002Frestaurants: ill preface with fact that we always appreciate buffets-- as no real wait, lots of options, self-serve, convenient, etc. So we enjoyed it. The cook staff worked so hard! There were a few in particular who did a superb job & really were giving it their all! I'm in the large event business and also have done back-of-house restaurant prep work\u002Fwaitressing in my lifetime. Thus, I can relate to the undertaking of executing that scale of service on a daily basis. The pigeons didnt particularly bother us; however, in hindsight, I realize it is odd not to manage them better. Also, one evening there were bugs everywhere but staff began spraying & almost instantly they were gone so not sure if that was an oversight i.e., staff didn't get to it in time-?  Also, there was an iguana that visited out Breakfast table, too! We wondered why no screens or netting along perimeter where it's open-? Honestly, these type of \""issues\"" just don't\u002Fdidn't stress us out. We actually find it somewhat charming\u002Fadding to the experience. But, we are very flexible type people who do tend to roll w\u002Fthe 'adventure' of it all.\n*staff: one thing that did strike me is how young many of the staff are. Not to be misconstrued here as \""reverse agism\"", lol (we are 55 & 57); just there is a certain 'gravitas'\u002Fexperience that comes with being a bit more seasoned. I would recommend the hotel provide training to the young staff (and truly, many were def in the early 20's range). And perhaps pair a young crew with a well-experienced team member for mentoring. For example, at the coffee\u002Fbar there was some attitude & Tom-foolery\u002Flack of attentiveness\u002Fcustomer awareness, etc. that should be addressed for sure. Same with car-rental desk, no one there, waited 20 minutes. Lots of younger staff slurping smoothies. I just was trained sooo differently many moons ago in the business.  Could just be the way of the world now . We deeply enjoy authenticity & young people immensely, but hotel will need to train better or hire with an eye to elevating sophistication of staff in order to achieve truly stellar  service.\n*Entertainment: was decent, but we are spoiled by the Hilton in Montego Bay Jamaica, that does a great job.  I work with specialty entertainment vendors for events all the time for events\u002Fgalas & have thoughts! \n*bottom line: we would definitely stay here again & look forward to next time. Curacao is an absolutely STUNNING tropical getaway that is safe, friendly & affordable not to mention convenient for us (from NYC general area). We enjoy the Hilton brand & our general sense is that this property is \""on the rise'. It'll be interesting to see where they ascend to. \n\n",4,positive,"August 23, 2023",Pater Eeuwensweg 31,"('Willemstad',)",,

The entire staff is exceptional and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was nothing short of perfect. The beach was spotless- no rocks and even cleaner than the last time we visited.

They are not anywhere near what I expect a Hilton Curio property to be. I was duped. I've been to Hotel Del Coronado, and this can't hold a candle to that place. I have been going to the\u00A0 Caribbean since 1992 and never had this bad of service. Accommodations are anything but accommodating. The front desk is horrible and will lie as if they were taut to. They actually charged me more then what our reservation was for an gave me some excuse about the reservation was booked wrong.\u00A0 Tha t is shady for sure. The staff is pathetic except for a select few. Monique is really what all your staff should be. Lazy doesn't describe how badly some of the employees are at the seemingly simple tasks they are assigned.I told a girl who was part of the staff I had a used coffee cup I was going to leave on a counter, and she said, I quote \""no put it down at the end of the walk way with the other dirty dishes\"". Sorry, I don't work here. My wife had to go downstairs to get toilet paper and there is never towels. You call down for towels and 2 hours later still no towels. We got back that evening and still didn't have towels for the morning A bus person with a rolling cart was clearing 1 table and pushing the cart to empty it and going to clear another table. There are dirty dishes and empty glasses all over the place, and the staff will allow a guest to wait while they finish a non-work conversation or finish playing on there cell phones before acknowledging you are standing right in front of them.\nAs a \""Diamond Member,\"" which means absolutely nothing, the staff could not care less how much of an inconvenience they put you through. The attitude of some of them, making faces and raising eyebrows when all you want to know if your new room is ready is pathetic. They also know English but will speak another language in front of you to each other while trying to figure out what mistake they have made is bad business and disrespectful. Maybe respect is too much to expect from a front dest person, I mean, they do work in the Caribbean after all. Yeah, right. The first three days,\u00A0 all we did was move rooms because the front desk has terrible customer service skills. The TV's do not work right and when we called to have them fix the issue they say they arr aware of the issue but never do anything about it.\u00A0 The room doesn't get cleaned or towels replaced and, house keeping will let something broken stay that way instead of letting maintenance know. \nI will say the food is good, but the buffet starts shutting down way before closing, so about an hour before they stop bringing out fresh food, and you will just have a few things to pick from. Thats just being cheap. In the main cafeteria, there are pigeons everywhere. You can't leave anything alone because they will have eaten it before you get back. They even fly on to your table while you are eating. \nEmployees are miserable and paid less than other resorts, and UT really shows in their attitude. \nThe beach is the worst I've ever seen in the Caribbean and nothing like it shows on the internet. It's all rocks that are hard as hell. The maintenance staff is however top notch and a group of really good guys.

Check-in must be entirely stress-free to ensure guests feel welcome and trust that they've selected the right place for vacation. We did not experience that at the Coredon. There were 4-5 desks for check-in and check-out without a line queue. Someone must take over greeting guests upon arrival and guiding them to the appropriate desk. \n\nOverall, the upkeep and cleanliness were below average. Pigeons and feces covered the tables guests were expected to eat on. Pigeons jumped up on the food areas by the beach and pecked at the food we were expected to eat. This was true in the open-air restaurant as well. We constantly had to fight birds while eating. It was disgusting and reminded me of the bird flu in the early 2000s. \n\nThe food options were slim, and impossible to get a reservation. The resort was overcrowded during the day, and I assume this is from folks getting a day pass access to the facilities. \n\nThis also rang true for the conditions of the room. There was a gas smell in the first building, we stayed in room 1125, and the odor was in the bathroom. We also had three towels daily when we booked and reminded housekeeping that four people occupied the rooms. The bed covers had questionable and disgusting stains for our kids to sleep on. The room odor was unresolved, and we had to beg and repeatedly call every night of our six-night stay for towels.\n\nThe nightly entertainment was the best part of our stay. The guys that operate the pool bar in the evening hours after 7 pm were phenomenal. They kept the bar clean; they were attentive and welcoming, and made quality libations.\n\nHowever, the daily kids' activities could have been more organized and left much to be desired. The everyday kid's activities and club were partly why we booked the Coredon; had we known this was false, we would have selected another property to spend our time in Curacao. This is understanding that the property is going through extensive renovation. No contingencies were in place, and the kids club was left vacant daily, even during scheduled activities.\n\nMuch of this can be mitigated with proper procedure and extensive staff training. There needs to be some overhaul in management and training. I'm surprised that the Coredon is a part of the Hilton portfolio.\n",2,negative,"August 3, 2023",Pater Eeuwensweg 31,"('Willemstad',)",,

When I asked the Hotel Manager told me that the major construction just started and it\u2019s going to be loud off and on for the next year so unless somebody\u2019s been there recently in the last 10 to 14 days you can\u2019t go by their noise level review. The constant loud banging is not enjoyable \uD83D\uDE02 \n\nPositives: very beautiful beach with clear water and fish and nice sand and side pools. Mostly good food, breakfast consistently good lunch and dinner mostly. Nice rooms with comfortable beds. Good working AC and Wifi. Talapas are easy to get and only $20 a day and lots of shade. Hilton gold or diamond members get 2 free a stay. The housekeeping is excellent clean everyday and towels etc. Airport is excellent have great staff and can get in and check bags and by gate in 30 minutes or less. Just make sure eat before go to airport bc limited food there. We used Norwin for transport back and forth he was excellent thanks to whoever recommended him. The town is a quick 10 minute walk and lovely walk over bridge and great for souvenirs. Definitely recommend going during the day if walking. There are people who beg there but its not terrible, I wouldnt go at night though.  Nice waterpark for littles, larger one ok often big slide not working bc of water pressure and tubes are minimal and not inflated. The staff is very friendly and try their best for being so short staffed. There are lots of great photo ops to take yourself everywhere. \n\nCons: The Construction is soo loud starts at 6am and goes til 4\u002F5. I wanted to sleep in but never could \uD83D\uDE1E, also when trying to enjoy the beach it was soo loud and at breakfast and lunch couldn\u2019t hear who you were trying to talk to over the noise. If I knew how bad it was we would have never have stayed here. It is very hard to get a drink. Only 2 bartenders on the beach 2\u002F3 by the pool and usually none at the waterpark. The best restaurant is the sushi and seafood, Italian was not good at all neither was bbq. The buffet is hit or miss. If youre not there when first opens food is not replenished for an hour or more. There is usually not chicken nuggets at dinner so if your kids only want kiddie food save them from pool snack area. The main pool is cloudy and smells awful we did not go in. The pool bar was under construction know reopened hopefully they fix the water issues though. Playground was damaged and is unsafe hope it gets fixed. Bottled water is not to be found on the beach or by the pool have to bring from room but itll get hot quickly. The self serve soda and beer machines are empty except seltzer and are not refilled even after asked many times. Do not try the tap beer at the buffet my husband wa electrocuted and more people \uD83E\uDD26\u200D\u2640\uFE0F. Also checkin process is a nightmare got there at 3 told to come back at 4 huge line didnt get room til almost 6. Definitely pack swimsuits etc on carryon ao can enjoy resort while waiting and not sit around. The elevators are very small and slow and have no ac. Make sure bring bugspray for nighttime bc a lot of mosquitoes.\nMedicore\uFFFC: For gold and diamond members, theres a seperate whatsapp feature you\u2019re supposed to be able to use but lots of times nobody messages you back for at least a whole day. One thing that is good is you can plan dining reservations for the whole entire week not day by day. Pigeons are not terrible but they are everywhere and if staff dont clear tables they are all over which was sometimes a little gross \uD83D\uDE02 \nAlso Wednesday is a nightmare its cruiseship day. Tons and tons of people fill the resort, its very difficult to get drinks and nowhere to sit at meals and very little food its not right for regular guests. Id definitely recommend leaving the resort that day and doing a tour or something. \n\nWould I stay here again: Possibly but not until the construction is done and hopefully they have a lot more staff and restaurant seating and more bars bc now its hard to find tables cant imagine with double the people. \n\nI now do know why its so inexpensive though so for the money pricepoint its on point bc we paid for 6 people less then we paid for 2 at another all inclusive. If looking 5 star its not, but its not awful either maybe 2-3 star. Any questions can pm me. We did make the best of it and it\u2019s definitely better then Hilton rose hall.\n\nTip: bring your own snorkel gear otherwise you have to rent it there for $15 a person a day and it\u2019s not always available.",3,negative,"August 16, 2023",Pater Eeuwensweg 31,"('Willemstad',)",,

data/ca/147278/19849230/896323531.html,"Mangrove Beach Corendon Curacao All-Inclusive Resort, Curio by Hilton","""I stayed here with a group of 9 people (booking 6 rooms total). We experienced travelers and have been to resorts all over the world, including the Caribbean. I can honestly say that Mangrove Beach Corendon is NOT worth the price being charged. We found Cura\u00E7ao to be a beautiful country with amazing sites, people, and food. However, these things are best experienced while staying elsewhere. You should either refrain from book at an all-inclusive or save up more money and stay at Sandals. Here are the pros and cons. \n\nPros:\n-The reception staff is very friendly and helpful. \n-The rooms are clean (except for the towels)\n-The risotto and the steak at the Italian restaurant (though not cooked to specification) are both very flavorful.\n-The resort has a waterpark. This is a unique amenity that you don\u2019t get at most resorts. \n-There is a cigar bar available. This is the only place you can get drinks that have legitimate alcohol in them. But you must pay for them.\n-The fitness center is ok for a hotel.\n\nCons:\n\n-There is no sense of urgency or respect of one\u2019s time by the service staff. They will talk on their personal phones while guests stand in line and wait for service. I have picture evidence of this as well. \n\n-The entertainment is poor. The best idea they had was a \u201Csilent party.\u201D I\u2019ve been to these before and they are a lot of fun because there is usually something for everyone. Each person is given headphones with different \u201Cstations\u201D available for listening. Your group can listen to whatever music they like and you can see other people enjoying whatever they are listening to. However, this resort thought it was a good idea to try and charge attendees an additional $25 to attend. As a result, only 5 people participated. The employee at the resort called it a \u201Cfiasco.\u201D\n\n-The drinks are BEYOND watered down. I\u2019ve been to many resorts and I have experienced watered down alcohol, but this resort is by far the most egregious I have ever seen. The drinks have are so watered down that shots won\u2019t even do much for non-drinkers. If you like sugary juices with pretty colors and no alcohol, this is the place to be. My wife is a non-drinker and weights 120 pounds (54 Kg) . She took several shots with us because of the occasion and didn\u2019t feel a thing. At least they can\u2019t water down the beer. I ended up just buying some liquor outside of the resort to supplement what they serve at the resort. \n\n-The towels are cheap and many have stains. Simply disgusting. \n\n-There are no irons in the room and ordering one is like a lottery that you likely won\u2019t win. \n\n-All dinner restaurants (except for the buffet) require reservations and there are nowhere near enough slots for guests. You need to be quick each day to schedule a reservation. \n\n-There are big windows of time throughout the day when there is no food available on the resort. We did activities outside of the resort and return at 3pm some days and could not eat because no restaurants (not even the buffet) are open between 2:30 and 5:00pm. And there are other windows of time where the is no food as well. Luckily, we enjoyed the wonderful restaurants off of the resort. However, this further diminishes the value of staying at an all-inclusive. \n\n-The staff will also not give you bottled water outside of the bottles received during your room service replenishment. You have to request a glass of tap water. \n\n-The late night server at the grill bar is extremely rude and miserable. He will deny you access to items that are supposed to be available to guests. It took another employee to come over and grant access to items. He said \u201Cnot to worry about the other guy.\u201D\n\n-The buffet eating area is plagued with pigeons and this is the only place to eat for breakfast. The birds walk on tables and even the \u201Cclean\u201D silverware they have waiting for you. It is also plagued with bacteria as people are constantly sneezing, coughing, and touching food with their hands. Even when not using their hands, the utensils are filthy with hundreds of hands touching them during each meal. \n\n-The fitness center is ok, but lacks wipes for the equipment and runs out of cups for water. Remember, they also refuse to provide bottled water outside of your room replenishment.\n\n- 5 out of the 9 people in my group became sick after eating at the outside bar area. \n\nOverall, the Mangrove Beach Corendon has a decent physical appearance but the service is lacking and the \u201Call-inclusive\u201D options leave a lot to be desired.  It is certainly not worth what they charge. \n\nYou should rent an AirBNB and a rental car, buy a few bottles of liquor and enjoy the great food and experiences that Cura\u00E7ao has to offer OUTSIDE OF THE MANGROVE BEACH CORENDON RESORT. You will have a better time and save a ton of money. Or just put up more cash for Sandals and enjoy a real all-inclusive resort. A rental car is the way to go if you plan on enjoying the area. Taxis are expensive and add up quickly. If you want to use taxis, download the 24-7 Taxi app as Uber is not available.

There is a beach bar and grill open for snacks in the beach pool area & the slide area. We were never hungry that is for sure. The buffet style was a little strange with pots you had to lift covers to get food but I noticed the same thing at the airport and other local eateries so I think that is how they do it in Curacao.

Yes, the resort is all-inclusive, all food and alcohol is absolutely free. The resort has no hotel shuttle, but the taxi service is incredibly easy. Drivers are nice, it is safe, and even talk about the island on drives. Just follow the Taxi signs at the airport. It takes about 15 minutes from the airport to the resort. Will be about 35-40 USD. I suggest downloading the 24-7 Taxi App when you land, it is the same as Uber in US\u002FEU for taxis. All taxis have a \""TX\"" license plate. Getting from the resort to downtown is about 15-20 USD, but it is easily walkable. It is around a mile walk to the Queen Anna Bridge and felt just as safe anywhere else. Do not be scared by the state of the buildings on the drive in! It gets very nice at the resort and looks like Copenhagen with colorful buildings as you approach downtown. \n\nThe staff has mixed reviews on here, but we had pleasant interactions. All staff speak English, Dutch, Papiamento, and Spanish fluently. A young man named Cristian went above and beyond to check on our room when we arrived. Bar staff is usually very busy so might come across as stern, but never rude. \n\nThe room itself was nice and clean. The bed, bathroom, and sheets were spotless and housekeeping cleans once a day unless you put the provided \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign on the door. Only compliant was that the walls near window could be re-painted. Balcony was spacious, we had a good view of the pool and if leaning on rail could see the beach. Lights work like more modern EU hotels, putting the card key into a slot to use. \n\nThe beach itself is primarily enclosed, but very rocky on the side closest to the buffet restaurant. The western end features an opening out to the open sea by the seafood restaurant. Overall, nice beach and always had seating, but to get spots with umbrellas (free) or the cabanas ($20\u002F$100 with beds) get there early. The first day we got somewhat burnt since we had no shade covering. Nice swings and sign for pictures and also a cool platform in the middle that is anchored down where you can swim to and check out fish and jump off into the water. One day a cruise ship embarked and took up a lot of seats but it only happened once for half a day.\n\nThe food was better than I thought. There is a main buffet restaurant for breakfast\u002Flunch\u002Fdinner, four themed restaurants (BBQ, Italian, Seafood, Sushi), the lobby bar that has small finger sandwiches and dessert, and finally something called Food Street. To eat at the themed restaurants (dinner only), you must reserve a table early in the morning online. The Italian was closed for reservations, but the Seafood\u002FSushi were excellent. The BBQ had good food and excellent service, but the smoke from the grill can go right into your face, making it unpleasant at times. The buffet has a ton of options, with a fruit station (all meals), cold cut station (all meals), dessert station (lunch\u002Fdinner), salad station (lunch\u002Fdinner), and snack station (all meals). Also two sliding toasters with a huge variety of bread. All meals have about 10-12 options around a rectangular cooking space, and they do themed nights as well. The big negative were the pigeons. They are everywhere around the main restaurant (they don't go into where the food is served, at least). Food Street is right behind the main pool bar, where from 11 AM-5 PM lighter food is served, such as fries, burgers, Dutch treats, and shawarma. It is also open late night 11PM-2AM. \n\nEntertainment was good, had Karaoke, special performers, pool games, and trivia on the beach. Both lead entertainers were great at their jobs. Water park for kids with an extra smaller bar there as well. Overall, all staff involved were having just as good a time. One issue was due to construction at the Italian place, which is right next to the main entertainment area. There would be workers using loud instruments as late as 9.30 PM! Other guests had to tell them to stop as we could not hear. \n\nOverall, we would definitely stay here again and it is highly recommended for both romantic and family vacations. The money we spent by choosing an all-inclusive more than made up for the difference at another nice hotel that was not. We had a huge amount of food and drinks that would have cost a fortune elsewhere. The prices in downtown Willemstad are not great, especially for food.",5,positive,"July 17, 2023",Pater Eeuwensweg 31,"('Willemstad',)",,

There were 9 couples in total for a birthday celebration. The rooms were amazing and I am glad we paid the upgraded cost for a large room that faced the ocean, we saw sunsets every night and it was a very comfortable well appointed room.  Oka and her housekeeping staff were excellent!\nThe highlights were definitely the people that worked at the resort. All were friendly and helpful and the real standouts for me were:\n\nShayna...at the smoothie bar!\n\nSabrina...Roro...Julien....Micha... and Shana at the beach bar.\n\nMeesha at the front desk\nRoju  for omelets...he's the best and the happiest man to see in the mornings.\nCarella.... at Dushi Sushi.\n\nAlso I cannot remember his name but at the cigar lounge was a wonderful young man that had been appointed there as he had an injury from a car accident. He was in his 4th year of university  to become a physiotherapist.  He made our evenings and went out of his way to make me an excellent  dirty martini even running out to the buffet to get Olive juice!\n\nFor me the food and the buffet was all right however the pigeons were nasty. We stayed at a resort just down the street and it had an open Buffet as well and they did not have pigeons they had other birds like pretty yellow canaries but no pigeons , that part was very weird. Also at the buffet every morning the coffee urns were broken often so out of the 7 days we were there I only had the coffee urns work once. The other option was these machines that made the type of coffee you asked for however it was not very good and most of those were out of order as well. So if you are a coffee lover like me, my only option was to stand in line at The Patisserie every morning to get a special coffee or use the instant coffee in my room which was not very good at all.\nThe food at Dushi Sushi  and the BBQ was very good. The seafood restaurant and the Sicilian restaurant we're all extremely, extremely, extremely, salty. Every dish. Even dishes that you would not think could be salty we're salty.\n\nAlso just be aware that it is virtually impossible to get change for small bills. The accountant doesn't seem to have a steady supply of dollar bills or small denomination bills. Even trying to buy something up the resort store was difficult because they did not have . I know many Europeans don't tip however as a Canadian I am used to it and enjoy tipping for good service however the resort could never supply us with small bills so that appeared to me that they were hurting their own employees. I resorted to changing Twenty dollar bills where I could at \n the tip jars  at the bars. \nThe previous resort I stayed at had an endless supply of small bills to exchange.\n\nAlso one more thing for my fellow Canadians if you are craving a Caesar they do not have Clamato. However it was available at the resort next door. I found that bringing my own celery salt and asking them for a bloody mary was just about  as good as a real Clamato Caesar however they often did not have Worcestershire either so next time I would bring my own little stash.",3,negative,2 weeks ago,Pater Eeuwensweg 31,"('Willemstad',)",,

The Room was clean and comfortable, with a great view of the Ocean.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.   One of the elevators was a bit musty and needed attention which was our only negative.    All-inclusive means you will eat and drink too much but are on vacation.     I have a few more Caribbean Island that I would visit but Curacao is an Island that is worth visiting.    \n\nThe Hotel has three sizable pools. The Main Pool in the Hotel pictures looks like a relaxing place, but I won\u2019t go in the water.   The water is very cloudy, which may be due to having a Pool Bar at the end of the main pool and tends to be a hangout for the drunks.  On most days, we preferred one of the quieter and \u201Cclear\u201D pools at the side of the Hotel.   \n\nDuring the day, there was construction nearby that would double the size of the Hotel, so any daytime noise may be an inconvenience if you had a room on that side of the Hotel.   It appears that the Hotel is doubling its size. \n\nThe main restaurant has a special main course each day and a great variety of bullet style food and drinks.   All the restaurants are open-air so you may see a few birds in the morning, but the staff does a good job keeping the area clean.   If you go back to the buffet for seconds you should leave someone at your table or you may find that it\u2019s been cleaned and reoccupied.       \n\nGetting a restaurant reservation was not a problem for us.   The Hotel\u2019s BBQ restaurant was our favorite restaurant, but I asked them to reduce the amount of food they served us because it was just too much to waste.             \n\nThere was only one cruise ship for the week we were at the Hotel.    Many Cruise ship passengers buy a Day Pass to use the Hotel facilities so that the Hotel will be busier on the Cruise Ship day.     \n\nDowntown is a short walk from Shopping and Pictures with a Drug Store near the Hotel.   \n\nUseful mobile apps\nCuracao Travel: (Required app), Information about many aspects of the Island: Hotel, Restaurant, excursions. Before your arrival, you must complete\u002Fsubmit your Digital Immigration Card, which simplifies Curacao\u2019s Customs entry process.        \n\nWhen you check into the Hotel, they will give you a link to their app Corendon Mangrove Beach Resort Curio by Hilton that overviews the Hotel and for requesting Services, Dining, points of interest, etc. \n\nWhat\u2019s Up:  it\u2019s a great messaging app for communicating with Hotel (Dinner Reservation, Room Services, etc.) and Car Rental (Smart Wheels with their service deck at the Hotel).   (It\u2019s better than the Hotel app for reservations.)\n\nMobile Passport Control (MPC):  US Travelers: When you travel to Aruba, you clear US Customs in Aruba, but departing Curacao, you will clear US Customs in the US.     If you don\u2019t have a Global Entry, then MPC is a must to avoid the long lines in US Customs.    But of course, in Maimi, you wait an hour after Customs to claim your luggage and move it to another carousel which makes a tight airline connection risky.   I would allow three hours to get through US customs at the Miami Airport.        \n\n24-7 Taxi: Curacao has NO Uber service, but the app looks similar to the Uber app.   Great app for requesting a Taxi. All Taxi License Plates have a prefix of TX.    A Taxi to\u002Ffrom the airport is $35 for up to 4 people.   \n\nCell Phone Coverage: We used the AT&T International Plan while in Curacao. $10\u002Fday unlimited calls and data (no Roaming charges) for the first phone, and each additional phone is $5\u002Fday.   These are daily charges, so if you want to avoid the daily charge, put your phone\u002Ftablet in airplane mode for that day.    Cellular coverage across the entire Island was good\u002Fno issues.\n\nGoogle Map:  The Curacao signage is not as good as other countries so that you will need this app.   This was the only mapping app that would give me turn-by-turn directions.  \n\nThere were NO Wi-Fi issues at the Hotel but limited availability elsewhere on the Island.   \n\nCar Rental:  Smart Wheels (hello@smartwheelscuracao.com) personnel were accommodating, available early, and stayed late.   If you make a reservation in advance, your Credit Card is charged.    There is a Gas Station across the street from the Hotel if you need to top off the tank when returning the car. Actually, it was more cost-effective to Rent a Car for several days, plan our own tour of the Island and go the Beaches\u002FSites we want to visit rather than be on a group excursion.     We drove to; Aquafari Tour, Flamingo Sanctuary, Landhuis Chobolobo, Playa Piskado\u002FPlaya Grandi (Turtle Beach),  Grote Knip,  Playa Forti (Cliff Driving), Tugboat Beach and Blue Bay Golf.        \n\nCurrency:  There was no need to exchange US Dollars. I didn\u2019t exchange cash on the trip.    \n\nExcursion:  West Coast Full-Day Tour with Beaches, BBQ and Blue Room (Irie Tours) \nGreat double-decker catamaran cruise with several snorkel stops to the Blue Room cave.   Penty of food, drinks and sunshine.  Transportation to the departure site is a small additional cost and well worth the expense.   The Curacao Beaches and Water are clear and beautiful everywhere.  \nMy recommendations:  Using a Mask and Snorkel that was just rinsed off it's good enough for me so bring your own Snorkel Gear.   The Tour's floatation device was a Noodle Float which may not be enough for many swimmers.  The Blue Room was a unique swim but don\u2019t go to the back of the Cave because the waves may slam you against the rocks.",5,positive,1 week ago,Pater Eeuwensweg 31,"('Willemstad',)",,

Having been to several AI resorts of all levels, here is my honest review. I realize everyone has different expectations, so keep that in mind. \n\nOverall the resort is nice but simple. I would give it 3.5 stars. \n\nThe grounds are pretty and clean (most of the time). Rooms are clean. Staff is friendly. Service is slow, but that is island time so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Rooms were cleaned daily and water was replenished. Although the number of towels we received daily seemed to diminish with each day that passed. I had to hide one so they gave us more. (I have a lot of hair & need 2 for shower.) water pressure not great but again, island life. Beach is small but nice, never had trouble finding a chair at pool or beach and beach towels were always available. It irked me that he Beach towels were Mis-matched. It was if they just bought random towels when they were on sale. You would think that Hilton has a central place to buy uniform towels for all their resorts but not the case. \n\nSnorkeling in the beach, Cove was really good. They were always plenty of fish in an occasional see turtle to see.\n\nFood was just ok. I found it annoying you had to get in line 9 AM to make dinner reservations for the next day. People waited in line for an hour so they could get dinner reservations. It was very difficult traveling with a big group in this way not all of the restaurants are open every day so we found ourselves being forced to eat the Buffet for dinner several nights, the dinner buffet was mediocre at best, and if you didn\u2019t get there early, they stopped replenishing food about 45 minutes before it closed for all meals. We found ourselves walking into town, a couple of nights to eat dinner, because we were bored of the food. the street food was great but towards the end of the day they were running out of plates and glasses. The self-serve coffee and soda pop stations were often out of glasses towards the end of the day. There is no beach or pool service, however, there was always a bar within 10 steps, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal, the alcohol is bottom shelf, so we did buy a couple of top shelf bottles from duty-free in town. The alcohol wasn\u2019t terrible, we just like what we like, so we took care of it on our own. It was nice that we could leave the property and go into town, unlike other resorts, and other islands, are you are confined to your resort. The main pool was the dirtiest pool I\u2019ve ever swam in. It is so murky that you cannot see the stairs and several times we would be swimming in the pool and catch a hairball on your feet or hands. It is also extremely deep. There are no shallow spots so if you\u2019re under 5 feet tall, this is not a pool for you. There are two smaller pools either side of each building, which were much cleaner and a little bit more shallow. We found ourselves spending time there instead of the main pool. \n\nWe walked into town, it was about a 10 minute walk. Easy walk, and very safe taxis were readily available for us to explore the island, which is beautiful. we did an excursion with blue fin charters to Klein Curacao.

Its huge and actually quite difficult to navigate all the halls\u002Fcorridors, lifts, escalators etc. to find where you want to go. e.g. trying to find the way out to the nearby subway station can be confusing - signage in English could be improved.\nHowever its definitely quality accommodation. Its beautifully kept, not just clean, but polished, there are polite staff everywhere and it has lots of facilities, though TV channels could be improved.\nRoom is very generous by Japanese standards - the size would put most to shame. e were in the Garden Wing and were amazed at the walk from the main reception area (almost 100m).\nWe got our room at what we considered a very good rate for Tokyo but beware of the extras - in-house restaurants, breakfasts, dining etc. are mostly frightfully expensive. There are maybe 2 in house restaurants (of the 38?) that are reasonably priced but you have to search them out. If you want to eat on a budget go to the nearby area around the train station, there are cafes and convenience stores there.\nThe proximity to the metro line is good for getting around Tokyo but I would recommend that if you are arriving by train to Tokyo Central you catch a taxi with your luggage as the subway line doesn't run from Tokyo central station. Also when leaving if you have an early flight don't rely on the bus service as it won't get you to Narita for a 9.30 am flight - back to Tokyo Central and catch the Harita Express.\nAn absolute mind boggling hotel due to its scale - I can only assume its not 5* because it is so huge it doesn't quite have that homely feel.",5,positive,"November 5, 2018",4-1 Kioicho,"('',)",Kanto,102-8578

We checked the website, found a room that could accommodate 4 people at about $500 a day and off we went.\n\nFirst of all let ne say that the name of the hotel is a bit of a misnomer. The last time anyone could call this hotel new was probably about 40 years ago. The carpets, the furniture, the electronics were all vintage 1985.\n\nThis hotel is huge. Check this out, it has 35 restaurants and bars. That's right thirty five!\n\nIt also has its own park, an indoor and outdoor pools with some weird rules etc. An airport shuttle takes you to the hotel. A taxi from Narita costs $250 A decent dinner for 4 will cost at least $140\n\nFour restaurants serving breakfast. We checked out 3 of them. Decent selection which kind of gets old after a few days. Please note that only one restaurant has an omelet station.\n\nService was hit and miss. Everyone tried to be very helpful but their approach was strange to say the least. Four people sit at the table, waiter  brings 3 glasses of water...\n\nOne day house keeping made the beds and that was all they did. No joke. Trash was not taken out, fresh towels were not provided. After we complained, the manager apologized profusely but again...\n\nSince this is an old hotel, it offers bigger rooms than the modern Tokyo hotels. Our suite consisted of a living room with a sofa and a bedroom in which they put 3 beds.\n\nSmall bathroom with a high tech Japanese toilet, no separate shower. An odd sink outside the bathroom.\n\nLocation was not bad. Five minute walk to the subway station. The problem with Tokyo is that it is insanely spread out so it is impossible to walk anywhere, you have to rely on public transport.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel, especially if you travel with a family. It is not a five star despite their rating on trip advisor and in the United States it probably would not even be a 4 star property, but then again we were in Tokyo and pickings were slim unless you wanted to spend close to 1K per night.",3,negative,"October 13, 2019",4-1 Kioicho,"('',)",Kanto,102-8578

In addition, I have read in past reviews that the floor in the rooms is a bit dirty.  This apparently has not been resolved as we experienced the same.  Visually they do not look dirty but if you walk in white socks, they would literally turn nearly black on the bottom.  After that I wore sandals while in the room.  The cleaning staff should do a better job at cleaning the floors.\n\nThe main downsides for the hotel, which is the reason for the one star reduction, is the room service from the Passions restaurant and the check out process.  We ordered room service once and after that experience I would not order room service nor choose to eat at the restaurant again.  We even canceled our reservation for two because of the poor service.  For room service, I ordered a meal for 5 for our family.  I think that a restaurant like Passions could make a simple hamburger as even a fast food place could do better.  The first time they messed up the order as I am allergic to dairy so I sent it back.  The second time, the meat was raw (not rare)!  This presents a potential health hazard and I certainly did not want to spend my vacation in an Aruba hospital.  After that, they said they would credit me for the order.  They then brought the burger for a third time and it was jerky fried.  Just because I don't eat raw meat doesn't mean I like beef jerky!!  I didn't want to send it back a third time and so I reluctantly ate whatever I had.\n\nThe other issue was checkout.  It turned out that after all the issues with the room service order, they never gave me the credit!  That took some time to straighten out.  The next issue is that I had ordered a non-alcoholic drink from the bar and apparently the bartender decided to give himself an extra tip.  This is very unethical behavior.  The front desk was able to straighten that out as well all while our cab to the airport sat waiting for more than 20 min.\n\nOverall, I would stay again and recommend the resort but I would avoid ordering anything from Passions restaurant in the future.",4,positive,"April 24, 2023",J.E.

Kimberly went above and beyond for the last year with all the booking of rooms and any question I had while planning for this big trip!

Jerrick who helped us each day with chairs and floats was great! He was alway ready for this group each day. He was awesome!! Denise was there for anything we needed at our reception at Passions. Ann Maduro, who helped me with all the food and details for the wedding rocked it! She is a saint! The food was off the hook! From the meals for the reception to breakfast and lunch WOW!! Get a smoothly too!! Gerard was so helpful throughout the process when I began the planning of our wedding\u002Fhoneymoon. The housekeeping staff was probably the best I\u2019ve ever had! Every single employee at the Amsterdam Manor was awesome!!!  Rooms were beautiful! All the Aruba aloe products-shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotions and hand soap in the rooms were such a great bonus.

Our room was great, it was the perfect size for our family and very spacious.  We had the 2 bedroom suite with a kitchenette. Enough room to spread out. The resort itself is very beautiful, it\u2019s dated but has charm that I loved. I cannot say enough good things about the restaurant Passions on the beach. The food was great every single time. We tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner and did not have one complaint. The staff went above and beyond and probably some of the nicest people I ever met. They are also very helpful with recommendations of places to go on the island. The proximity of the beach was great and there was always plenty of chairs available each day.\n\nNow my cons\u2026\u2026 I really wish that we would have been told about the planned construction on our section of the hotel when we checked in. The fact they booked rooms there this week blows my mind. They started working on the room next to ours on Wednesday and continued the rest of the week. We were woken up early every morning with loud drills and hammering. So loud we thought it was coming through our wall. I went to the office to say something and was told a manager would contact me to find a solution\u2026.. that never happened! They still didn\u2019t say a word at checkout. Our last 4 mornings were miserable cause of all the commotion and noise. Not a relaxing environment at all. Again\u2026. They knew it was going to happen. Those rooms should have never been booked. \n\nThe beds\u2026.. be prepared because they are very hard and uncomfortable. The pillows they have are great but we struggled with how hard the bed was. \n\nNow The SMELL\u2026 \u2026.. I know this is not the hotels fault at all but I have to warn people. I saw the smell reviews on TripAdvisor before we even booked this place but a lot of people said sometimes it wasn\u2019t even noticeable and not that bad. Maybe it\u2019s the time of year but odor from the wastewater plant behind the manor was downright nauseating! The first two days it was tolerable but it got worse each day. We did excursions several days this week so it was nice to get away from it. Most of the time, the smell wasn\u2019t too bad once you hit the beach but by Thursday the smell was so awful, you smelled it down by the water as well. It also penetrated our suite so we couldn\u2019t get away from it even indoors. We had a lovely patio that would have been awesome to sit out in the evenings but the smell prevented that. It was like being in an overheated portable toilet!! It literally made you sick to your stomach. \nMaybe it\u2019s not bad other times of year but this past week was ripe!!! \nWe loved the island so much but will not stay in this area next time.

I had to keep the AC no higher than 20 C to keep the room from DRIPPING wet. The walls were sweating and the tile floor was so slippery I was skidding. We used towels to mop it up and it kept sweating. Housekeeping turned it down to 18.5 c to keep it drier. The walls were water damaged with clear water stains from prior times the room was dripping. I am not exaggerating. They moved us rooms when we told them. The new room was drier but still humid enough to make my papers damp. I\u2019ve stayed in hotels from stars 1-5, even in the tropics and never saw a hotel with this level of wetness. \n- the first night I called for help with the AC being 20 and me being unable to change the temperature. I was told \u201Cleave the door open and let the cold air go out and the warm air in\u201D. Its not a solution and is patronizing and illogical. But like a dumb tourist I blindly followed. This is what caused the room to be dripping wet even more.\n- Yes you smell sewage. Not their fault. It\u2019s on the beach too.\n- Ant issues. We had a thriving ant community in the potted plant by our table and the ground. So much that the second I dropped - crumb there was a frenzy. There are biting ants at their restaurant near the trees. When I told the waiter they were biting me he asked me why I was afraid of some ants and laughed. Well I woke up with bites and a red mottled rash on my arm and leg where they bit. These guys do bite.\n\nDon\u2019t let them tell you humidity is because you\u2019re in Aruba.

Folks note that you have to cross a street to reach the beach, but all Eagle Beach properties share this trait. We visited Palm Beach, and while you don't cross a street, there are more steps from room to beach than at Eagle because of the large lobbies and pool areas with pulsing music at all hours of the day than down at calmer Eagle Beach. And crossing the street is a breeze because the cross walk doubles as a speed bump and every car stops and waits for every patron to cross.\n\nThe beach is just beautiful. The hotel reserves chairs for you, and if you go out between 7-8 am you can get chairs next to palapas and leave your towel to hold your spot for later. Beach attendants are great, especially Benjamin. Very kind. They bring frozen fruit skewers around for free at least one each morning.\n\nYou can easily order from the Passions Bar during the day to get breakfast or lunch on the beach. I'd do that and avoid the overpriced and overrated dinner at Passions.\n\nThe pool is great as well, and includes a hot tub sized kiddie pool that is quite shallow.\n\nThe room was appointed well. Three TVs, free wifi. The kitchenette is nice and allowed us to cross the street to SuperFoods\n\nThe Less Good\nReviews note there is a nearby water treatment plant. There are some smells, mostly at the pool and Horizons poolside restaurant. However, it more smells like someone had gas. The smells rarely traveled to the beach or to the rooms. We might have had a whiff on the beach once or twice, but it passed. Never in the rooms.\n\nOur level of service wasn't great. We requested extra sheets and pillows for the sofa bed area. It took nearly an hour to arrive after we called at 7pm so our son could go to sleep the first night of arrival. Also, we requested this with our reservation so it probably should have already been in place.\n\nI like the wrist band keys they use for the door locks, where you just touch them to unlock. They are easy to keep with you, even in the ocean. However, the battery on our door broke twice we were there. Once it took 30 min to fix and another time an hour.\n\nOverall, I would stay here again because the room and location top the wait for service.

We had the $35 for 3 bags, 2 fire starters and a Mystic Fire pack deal. The wood burned well. \n\nWashrooms were clean, the showers had great water pressure and children's activities were plentiful. Our family enjoyed the chocolate bar bingo, the foam party on the grass, the hiking trail in the woods, catching fish in the pond (small perch and sunfish) and buying candy in the store. Campsites are typical of KOAs without much privacy but we did have full hook ups so cannot complain. Sadly, our son did not find any duck stickers to collect a souvenir duck though he looked each day. The pools were clear, comfortable temperature in the one two of us swam in. The store has slushies, ice cream, camp supplies, t-shirts, candy of all kinds and the usual camp shop wares. \n\nThe adult section we walked through looked very nice with large RVs, landscaping and such. \n\nRoads were maintained and campers we encountered were friendly. No loud noise late at night. We had free Wi-Fi which was not always a strong signal.\n\nThis campground location is great for visiting local attractions a half hour away such as Wasaga Beach, Sainte-Marie Among the Hurons and Discovery Harbour.

With that being said, I believe you guys are the GOLD standard for the KOA brand. I think the management at the barrie KOA needs to take over training and management of other KOA's to teach them how it's done. I was surprised that the regular cabins have heaters and air conditioning. With 35 degrees, I definitely used it. I also would like to commend you on the level of cleanliness. I'd say that the washrooms were cleaner than the one at house, and we only have 4 people. Initially, I was looking at a hotel in the area but I couldn't find a good deal nearby, so I had no choice but to book you guys. It turned out to be an awesome experience. Free and fast WIFI, access cards if we had to come in after 10. Breakfast on the weekends for people to buy. Even a service for the religious folk. All my positive comments are only for the Barrie KOA. Other ontario KOA's are just horrible.

We had a fantastic holiday but that\u2019s because we made it that way- not the hotel.  Most of the staff are completely disinterested in doing anything their role requires! It was like they were doing us a favour rather than treating us like hotel guests. A few staff members are excellent - Rohan, Reheem, Joenna, Thea, and Ria. A few others were nice enough too but some were just rude- like Chesterfield behind the bar by the pool and his colleague (wears a long sleeved black top underneath his shirt) - they were just off every time we asked for a drink - you almost felt bad for getting one! Only saw the cocktail list on one day and the rest of the time it wasn\u2019t around and\u002For they didn\u2019t have the ingredients. At breakfast only on 2 days out of 6 were there enough plates for guests or bowls.

data/ca/1183194/147699/923187557.html,Sea Breeze Beach House,"""I'll start out by saying that the Facebook fan page for this hotel is very dodgy,  don't be fooled by it nor the 5 star Tripadvisor reviews which are clearly fake.  There is one woman who posts all the time and her profile doesn't seem real - she posts the same photos as those on TripAdvisor, she's also the admin of the group.\n\nSo,  we came to this hotel on the 19th October for 7 nights,  expecting the luxury food and drinks promised via their website.  On day one of our holiday (PRIOR to the storm that hit that week), the luxury room block was no longer receiving water, so no toilets or showers.  Initially I was fairly understanding but expected it would be fixed very quickly.  Well it wasn't resolved for 48 hours,  communication was non existent and we were given the following excuses after calling all day long:\nWater pressure problem - don't worry,  we've fixed it (1 hour later the problem is not fixed).\nLeak somewhere,  bear with us while we dig up concrete (there was no digging and no water).\nLocal authority water shortage (yeah OK...)\nAnd then finally,  when the storm hit they blamed the storm.  \n\nI asked the staff what the back up plan was,  they couldn't expect us to be paying \u00A31k per night and have no toilet or shower.  They told us they would bring us a bucket to flush the toilet but there were no rooms to move us to, this was unbelievable to me.  The hotel have tried to say this only lasted 24 hours but this is untrue. I've also got screenshots from the dodgy Facebook group where a 'fan' said we should all bathe in the sea, that he has stayed 5 times and has experienced power cuts and water outages and we should be OK with that.  I'm not ok with poor building management at a luxury hotel. By day 2, people were filling buckets with pool water. \n\nI also took pictures of the cockroaches in our luxury room,  I also saw them in the buffet room. \n\nThe food situation is simply dreadful here.  The amount of choice is so limited and they are incapable of cooking chicken or fish without it being so dry you need a drink to wash it down.  Cocktails are a joke too, there are no drink menus anywhere (I asked several times). I asked for an espresso martini and the bartender mixed vodka with filter coffee and poured it over ice into a tumbler! We also had 3 out of 7 days where there was no cranberry juice and no mint (no cosmos or mojitos). They also do not bring drinks to you at the pool, everything is self serve (another lie on the website).\n\nThe Cerulean restaurant served us mouldy chocolate mousse (I took a mouthful before realising!) and were never able to provide the full menu (scallops were clearly too expensive for them to order in,  so you could never get them). Don't expect to be delighted by fresh fish here,  I genuinely wouldn't eat any of their sushi - they don't even know how to cook eggs, I wouldn't be confident in their storage of sushi grade fish or cooked rice.  \n\nIn terms of snacks, there really aren't any unless you are savvy! Lunch doesn't start until 12.30 and the only way to get an icecream is to hope for a guy to come round on a bike.  He won't do this if it's wet on the ground. \n\nThe general upkeep of the hotel is poor, there is no feel of luxury.  The beds near the kids pools are left out in the rain so are mouldy and often so wet you have to remove the cushion completely.  The tables for drinks are dirty and need replacing. On the last two days of our trip, the kids main pool (which is very small and typically had 20-30 adults and children steeping in it) went so cloudy you couldn't see the bottom. There are no pool pumps and on the second day it was so bad they closed it entirely.  This meant all children had to use the smaller pool.\n\nBeds are nearly impossible to get at the kids pool which makes for a very uncomfortable holiday. They do not enforce rules about reserving beds but they do enforce rules stopping children getting in the adults pool.\n\nBy contrast,  the adult pool was always empty and the beds were bigger.  It's a farce really,  as a family, you are probably paying far more for a 2 bed luxury room yet you are treated like a poor relative.\n\nThere is no entertainment really, the rum shop is a grubby bar with a few cheese rolls and they do bingo once a week. \n\nYou may see that there is a hospitality suite listed for your use on checkout day, so that you can shower and relax before your flight.

The flight was good and it took just over an hour from landing to leaving the airport. Our transfer with a company called St James was quick and friendly, taking about 15 mins.\nCheck in was quick, easy and friendly. A drink of our choice and a cold towel is always a welcome treat. \nA dining reservation had been made for us for our first night and all of the information was provided in a welcome letter, we were escorted to our room by guest services with all the key restaurants, pools etc pointed out along the way. \nOur room was a Luxury Collection Ocean Front Junior Suite on the fifth floor, room 545. A big room, king bed with everything you could possibly need and stunning views. The bathroom was spacious with a HUGE shower. The room was spotless and cleaned daily with daily turn down service too.\nWe experienced all three dinner restaurants for dinner. The first night was Aqua Terra a chic ocean side restaurant with great sushi, wine and a blackened Mahi Mahi, second night was a beach BBQ by the Mahogany restaurant, my least favourite as I\u2019m not a fan of buffets but the ribs and chicken was great and the entertainment was just what you need! Third night was time for Cerulean, the fine dining option, this was my favourite and the surf and turf was perfect, such a lean cut! \nBy day there are three pools and of course the beach. While I like to relax, I like to move around the resort, so day one was the family pool and lap pool, there wasn\u2019t many kids as term time (otherwise we might have avoided it) it\u2019s also where you find the Flying Fish perfect for some lunch and a \u2018few\u2019 rum punches. The beach is simply stunning, lots of Sun loungers all with their own shade canopies! There is an adult only pool with two jacuzzi\u2019s and very comfy Sun loungers with two bars located there. Top tip if you like a quiet beach spot head to the beach by the adult pool, no one used it and it has a bar\u002Flunch spot called Tipsy, it\u2019s like your own exclusive beach, even though all the beaches on the island are public!.\nThe staff were some of the friendliest I\u2019ve experienced in the Caribbean and a few times a manager approached us to check everything was good.\nI notice a couple of reviews mention lack of music and evening entertainment. That\u2019s true, and fine by me, I don\u2019t need \u2018aqua aerobics\u2019 pushed on me everyday and if I want music by the pool I\u2019ll use my AirPods.

We arrived at the airport and my group of 10 were supposed to be greeted with a ride and no one showed up. We called the hotel and were told we had to find our own ride, which by the way was much less expensive than the hotel itself was going to charge us. We arrived at the resort and were greeted by some very nice gentlemen who took our bags and said they would take them to our rooms. 2 hours later when we were told our rooms were ready our bags were still not there. We had to go to the front desk and ask them to get our bags as we wanted to shower and get ready for the night. We had a group of 5 couples that all booked together but we were put in rooms all no were near each other because apparently some of us were of \u201Clow class\u201D while others were \u201Chigher class\u201D, not a very good way to explain it to your guests. This was all just a within a few hours of arriving at the Seabreeze. \n\nWhat went wrong\u2026NO MUSIC! Very, very poor management. Every time we had an issue excuses were made. There was no accountability for ANYTHING. It\u2019s advertised having 6 restaurants but only one or two were open at a time. We even made reservations a few nights and the place ended up being closed and NO ONE told us. Then when we went to go elsewhere we were told they were full. They had no activities, BINGO which lasted 40 minutes and Cornhole with 5 of the cheapest bags I have ever seen. Two hot tubs, one of which didn\u2019t work and the other one was duct taped and cold. Adult only pool closed at 8pm. Drinks ended at 10:30. Again, NO MUSIC. Thank god we had our own speaker and we were able to play music. We carried our speaker around and even the workers were dancing. When you\u2019re at an island resort you expect to hear island music ALL THE TIME!!!!!! \n\nWe constantly had to call the front desk for towels and waters for our room which took two or three calls every time. This is an automatic service that should happen without a phone call. Each day they came and made our bed and took dirty towels but never left clean ones. We were constantly told by the front that only specific people had access to towels therefore we had to wait until they were available. Maybe they should have just left clean ones when they took the dirty ones. \n\nOur best times that we had were times we left the Seabreeze and did other things. The Catamaran trip was fabulous, Scuba diving was great, the Boatyard was fun, shopping in Bridgetown and the Fish fry was good but every great experience we had at the Seabreeze was made fabulous by our own music that we brought and the people we were with. We walked around with our own music and many people looked at us like we were nuts while the employees themselves danced and wondered why they didn\u2019t have that all the time. Bartenders NEVER had smiles and were not happy to help (except for Colthbert) which I find mind blowing. \n\nThere were many, many service people that were great ( I wish I got more names)  but there was also many that didn\u2019t really seem to enjoy their job. We visited from America which seemed to be an anomaly, most guests were from the UK, but we were tippers and the employees should have appreciated that. I tried speaking to many employees and couldn\u2019t even get them to look in my face. A smile goes a looonnnggggg way and we couldn\u2019t get that. \n\nFor as hot as it is in Barbados many of us has issues with our A\u002FC units but when we asked management about it we were brushed off and basically told to deal with it. We got more attention from the drug dealers on the beach than we did from guest services.\n\nI also need to point out that when I booked this place I also asked for a stocked bar every day, a bottle of champagne and an airport transfer. When we arrived we did not get the transfer. We did have the stocked bar (only the first day) and our champagne was a cheap ass bottle of wine which we never drank. When I checked out at the end of the week they tried charging me for a stocked bar for seven days, the bottle of champagne and the airport transfer that never happened. I had to wait for manager to agree to not charge me for what I DID NOT RECEIVE!\n\nI do want to point out there we some employees that were absolutely fabulous, if I could list their names I would because they deserve it. Most of their issues are with management, they need some serious training in hospitality. And if the resort is supposed to be quiet and offer little to nothing to do then that\u2019s fine but it should be advertised that way. \n\nThe trip as a whole was fabulous only because of the company we were in. We were there for a friends 50th birthday as well as a wedding anniversary. If it weren\u2019t for the group of us anyone of us would have left the resort, taken the loss and booked somewhere else.",1,negative,5 weeks ago,Maxwell Coast Rd,"('Oistins',)",,BB15031

It was all for my wifes 50th and she never got anything from the hotel that we hadnt had to pay a lot extra for to celebrate her special birthday, we seen somebody else got balloons and banners but nothing for us, absolute joke of a hotel. Weve been to many all inclusive carribean hotels over the years, most been RIU hotels which have always been out of this world with service and overall experience. When we got there we thought wed landed in paradise but that soon changed when we realised 95% of the staff couldnt be bothered to even help you never mind make your stay a good experience. It was such a special time my wifes 50th but not at the Sea Breeze, wed numerous things that made it horrible. The first was we payed a lot of money extra for a bubble on the beach dining, well it took 3hrs for 3 people to get a 3 course meal. Aye could have cooked the steak quicker myself, to say we were all asking when this is going to finish is a understatement, even my wife which it was all for her birthday. We then ordered fast food from the pool restaruant on the night we were booked on the shuttle bus to oistins at 6.30pm. We sat down at 5pm and didnt get our food till 6.10pm which meant we were going to be late for the bus, my wife complained to the staff about the late service and the fact 2 tables got their food before us that sat down and ordered after us. My wife spoke to this usless duty manager, didnt take his name but should have. This person wasnt intetested in any bad news about the hotel or the staff, he just brushed it off and made it look like we were complaining about nothing, usless and ignorent is my best words to explain him. Aye asked the front desk manager if we could get on the 7pm bus cause the restaraunt had delayed us getting ready, she said only if theres room. I then asked, well if there isnt can you get the shuttle bus to do 2 trips so we could get to oistins because the food was late, her reply was its up to us to be on time. Another ignorant one in charge, the hotels full of them. I tried to speak to the manager about the bill for the bubble and got told 3 times he believed there was no need to speak to me face to face cause he said over the phone that we got the bubble service so wed to pay it in full whether we enjoyed or no. Finally i spoke to the manager which said he knew nothing about not wanting to talk to me, he looked into the grieveances i had and came up with wed get a private car to the airport instead of the normal shuttle., not perfect but he tried at least. We were 30 minutes from leaving the hotel and i asked if my 10yr old daughter could get some food, the same ignorant duty manager my wife spoke to said we werent allowed any food after 6pm cause we checked out that day. I asked why we werent told about this rule and he said its common practice with all inclusive, another lies. Weve stayed in loads of all inclusive allover the world and normally you get full use of drinks and food till you leave the hotel even if its late on in the night, just another clown in charge of a terrible hotel. So my advice to anybody thinking about Barbados is spend your money anywhere else in the carribean and get more for your money cause anywhere on the island most of the locals cant be bothered to do anything.

Fantastic start but on this all inclusive package holiday how did that sixth person sneak on the flight?!?!\n\nAnd why would you possibly want those interconnecting doors unlocked between the two rooms? Is it because your kids are in there or is it because after day 4 the electronic room lock was broken and despite being reported multiple times (and yes the key cards \u002F bracelets were reset by reception as well) it was not fixed for the subsequent 6 nights of the stay.\n\nFood - mediocre and inconsistent. Limited choices and weekly rotations so not great for stays of 7 nights plus. Kids meals are nuggets \u002F burger \u002F pizza and chips or basic pasta in every eatery.\n\nBeach - great selection of drugs available from the local dealers. I was offered an amazing deal for some weed on my final day, and it wasn\u2019t the sea weed. Locals offering various items for sale like shells, sharks teeth, etc or massage services. A couple of mobile chiropractors on the beach giving free tasters as all guests seem to need help straightening their backs. No drinks service ever seen although apparently available. If lucky you could pick up some free fish rotting on the shoreline to feed your family on your final day once all facilities have stopped for your stay. Clean beach towels were rarely available and when they were they disappeared very fast. Very limited \u201Cincluded\u201Dequipment to use but the 1\u002F2 hour on the jet ski for US$75 was okay though there was no accompanying paperwork like insurance, indemnity, etc.\n\nDrinks - ran out of Mount Gay Eclipse rum on day 5! Replaced by Brigand. Okay but how can you run out of the most famous rum in Barbados whilst in Barbados?!?! Complimentary spirits in room didn\u2019t contain vodka but actually water (note I didn\u2019t experience this personally) but the rum in the Eclipse bottles was being replaced with the cheaper and less palatable Brigand but the staff.\n\nRooms - very nice actually. Mini bar limited and inconsistently filled. Towels an issue. Cleaning a big problem. Housekeeping typically came at 16:30, and only on 6 days of our 10 night stay. Turn down service typically came at 17:15 which was as useful as a chocolate tea pot having only just had the room cleaned! Lovely sea view and the blackout curtains worked a treat.\n\nHowever, to go for 3 days without a toilet that flushed was wholly unacceptable. 2 of those days we didn\u2019t have running water. This is appalling and the lack of communication on the matter was dire. Some guests got buckets, we got nothing until I asked staff for some, 24 hours after the problem started. Yes there had been a storm, but the problems started before the storm hit and the excuses were poor. I am genuinely surprised there wasn\u2019t an outbreak of D&V as we couldn\u2019t even wash our hands in the room.\n\nStaff - generally those we interacted with at bars and restaurants were lovely people. The concierge \u002F activity desk team were all great too (Peggy, Joel and others). However\u2026\n\nReception staff were not nice at all, Kim in particular. Giggling away between themselves when there was an issue being reported, no effort made to help, never followed up on queries \u002F requests. Very rude. Unresponsive. Lied to me repeatedly. Set the tone for the management\u2026\n\nManagement. Non-existent. Managers refused to come and meet with guests in person, refused guests to meet in their office. Disappeared off site when supposedly available.left the staff hung out to dry.\n\nI could go on for hours about the terrible experience we had at this hotel but it is important to mention that the island of Barbados was fab overall. A lovely people and we tried our best to get into the Bajan culture. Harrison\u2019s cave was a good trip (albeit very expensive), a day touring the island is worthwhile and I would recommend Rogers Scuba Shack for diving with Seth (separate review to follow).\n\nBarbados - 5*\nSea Breeze Beach House - 1 or 2* at best, not the 4 1\u002F2* Virgin advertise by some distance.\n\nPlease note that the hotel staff may respond to this with their standard stock phrase stating customers were rude, shouting, abusive, etc. not the case. It\u2019s the stock excuse to try and mask their ignorance of the problems hey have there.",1,negative,2 weeks ago,Maxwell Coast Rd,"('Oistins',)",,BB15031

We booked the ocean front luxury suite\u2026a lovely big room with a gorgeous view of the beach. Massive bathroom, really couldn\u2019t fault the room at all. \n\nThere are 2 a la carte restaurants and the food at both was really good. We did get a little sick of the buffet at mahogany, breakfast maybe could have had a few more choices however Marcia and Andrea were great cooking you fresh eggs or an omelette every day, and they had so many on the go at once\u2026both wonderful women. \n\nUnfortunately there was a storm while we were there and the a la carte restaurants were shut for 2 nights, so we had to eat the buffet\u2026not a problem but a call to the people who had booked the restaurants or just something letting us know would have been better\u2026they want you to dress up in the restaurants so we had got ready only for the restaurant to be all shut up, we went to reception and was told it was closed due to the rain. This could be managed better I think.\n\nTipsy Tuesday is great as well as the Sunday bbq\u2026.lots of fun and we\u2019ve never been to an all inclusive in the Caribbean where you get an abundance of lobster like you do at Sea breeze.\n\nThere is enough sun beds for everyone, we plotted up on the beach every day and yes a few of the sun-beds are broken or a little worse for wear but we always found one. We had one day by the adult pool and the sun beds there are really comfy.\n\nThe staff were always very helpful, yes the service is slow but that is typical Caribbean style and we just went with the flow.\n\nThe hotel have a lot to keep people occupied. We tried Yoga twice and that was great, the instructor was brilliant. We done aqua aerobics once and that was great fun. We didn\u2019t try bingo but again looked fun. Champagne and canap\u00E9s at 5pm every day and afternoon tea is also offered daily\u2026both we tried once, and what a lovely touch it was. Evening entertainment always something (singers\u002Fsaxophonist etc) the music goes off at 10.30 each evening I have seen people complaining about this but again we found this is the \u2018turn down\u2019 time for most Caribbean hotels and that suited us perfectly as we are early risers.\n\nPeggy sorted us out a car to hire for the day which was great and all went smoothly. Special thanks to Tamika booking the restaurants, she was really helpful and gave us lots of advice.\n\nNot getting fresh towels when they had taken your old ones from the room is a little annoying, not sure why they couldn\u2019t be put in the room however a call to reception and they would soon be bought up. \n\nThe beach is beautiful a little seaweed but we\u2019ve had worse at other hotels, also out of the hotels hands, soft white sand and no need for swim shoes. We hired out the Paddle board and kayak. Only one Paddle board though as the other was broken. It would have been nice if we both could have used them together but again not a massive issue.\n\nWe also got a taxi at the airport for 27 usd and then Tyrone (sea breeze taxi driver) took us back for 30 usd so would recommend doing this as a lot cheaper than paying BA etc before you go.\n\nWe would recommend this hotel to friends\u2026.thank you Sea breeze for a wonderful stay",5,positive,4 weeks ago,Maxwell Coast Rd,"('Oistins',)",,BB15031

Although some work hard and were helpful, others i feel are short with you, when you ask things, which puts you off enquiring. 2 weeks we asked to do kayaking and not one day was this available throughout our holiday. The trampoline wasn't in the water for the full 2 weeks and this would have been magical for the kids and was important for us.  We eventually managed to get out on hobby cat a day before we left.

data/ca/1183194/147699/917155397.html,Sea Breeze Beach House,"""Stayed at the Sea Breeze for 12 nights in August 2023 after two years of waiting and it was definitely worth the wait! Travelled with three children (17, 15 and 11). \nRooms - We booked a two bedroom ocean view suite but ended getting two interconnecting ocean front suites (547 and 548 in the Mahogany block). Rooms were spacious, clean and had the biggest shower and comfiest bed we have ever experienced. Views were stunning and never heard any noise from other rooms, restaurants, local area etc. \nStaff - The staff are truly wonderful. Yes, there are a couple of perhaps more difficult members of staff, but 98% are absolutely brilliant and go out of their way to make sure you have an amazing stay. Particular mentions to Peggy, Rohan, Damien, Tarik, Noelle and many others whose names have escaped me. If you read any other reviews where they complain about staff, chances are it is because they don\u2019t treat the staff with respect! Manners and politeness cost nothing, and we had many conversations with staff and just tried to get to know them. \nFood - Our three kids can all be quite fussy eaters (youngest in particular is autistic and can have a very limited diet), however our difficulty was usually having to choose between options at dinner because it all sounded amazing! Breakfast consists of pastries, cakes, fresh fruit, cereal, hot dishes and eggs any way you like. We preferred to get to breakfast early (7-7.30am) which meant it was quieter and we got more time to spend round the pool or on the beach. Lunch we usually ate in Mahogany also as it changed the menu daily but the Flying Fish also do nice snack food. Dinners were always out of this world. We ate at the Cerulean twice and had the most incredible piece of steak I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Seafood buffet on Saturday and BBQ on Sunday were also excellent. Other than that we ate at Aqua Terra most nights and was our favourite place to eat. Quality of food was nothing short of exceptional. \nDrinks - Cocktails, wines and spirits were all very high end (highly recommend the Cabernet Sauvignon and Cosmo Punch). Mount Gay rum tasting session was also good and informed us on which to take home with us! They don\u2019t measure spirits like they do in the UK, so expect strong cocktails!\nPool - Loungers were very comfortable with drinks tables with Rohan and Damien ensure are always topped up. Had a couple of maintenance issues with the pool while we were there which the staff were proactive with and repaired (very minor and never had to close the pool). \nBeach - stunning white sand, clear blue waters and some decent waves which made it fun and enjoyable. Plenty of water sports equipment available. Unfortunately we had a lot of seaweed due to a tropical storm but nothing the hotel can do about that. My only gripe would be one of the beach vendors constantly harassing guests trying to sell aloe vera but, again, it\u2019s not a private beach so there isn\u2019t anything the hotel can do. \nLocation - We walked to Oistins one morning and only took twenty minutes, and also went on the complementary shuttle to the Friday fish fry which was a fantastic experience. 15 minutes to the airport and 20-30 minutes to Bridgetown (we did a turtle snorkelling excursion organised by the concierge). \nOther - The departure lounge is very useful as we had a late flight home (10.45pm) meaning we could still go in the pool and sea and have a shower to freshen up before leaving. We also renewed our vows while we were there which Debbie and Estlan did a great job of organising and helped make it as magical and memorable as we imagined. \nI would strongly recommend this resort to anybody. It\u2019s all inclusive but doesn\u2019t feel like it due to the high quality food and wonderful staff and it only has circa 120 rooms, so very minimalist and buffet meals don\u2019t then become overcrowded. There are a few bits to do and activities available in the hotel, but don\u2019t moan there isn\u2019t enough because who wants to go to Barbados to be constantly looking for something to do every hour? Just adopt the Bajan way - take it easy, go slow and enjoy every moment. ",5,positive,"September 18, 2023",Maxwell Coast Rd,"('Oistins',)",,BB15031

We came back to Barbados for a reason, to scatter my parents ashes, and as sad and emotional a time as it was it was perfect in every way. The Hotel was the perfect choice - it is lovely, just the right size that it doesn't look the personal touch. We stayed in an Luxury Junior Oceanfront Room (644) and what a fantastic room it was. Great view, it was so relaxing, the shower\u002Fbathroom was massive and the White Company products equally amazing. Yes we did have an issue with no towels in the room, mini bar not being restocked, no turn down but one call to Housekeeping and it was all sorted. The air con could have been slightly colder but again not a major issue - just had to relax a bit more and coolness followed!! It was so lovely to come off the beach, grab a drink from the bar and go to the room, put Netflix on and literally chill for a couple of hours before dinnner! The beach is beautiful. Sun loungers, what a fabulous idea with the shade that pulls over and shields from the sun. Yes there were a few broken\u002Fworn out but there were enough on the beach for this not to affect us in anyway. It would have been nice if one of the beach team had helped move the sunbeds but again no big issue - a bit of exercise for us! Beach service was sadly non existent and I'm not sure why. We were asked if we wanted drinks maximum 3 times in any given day and a few days no beach service was offered at all. Not a worry though as like everything else, the bar was a few steps away. We didn't go round any of the pools as spent all our time on the beach but the sunbeds were massive with thick padded cushions. I did venture to the pool for a dip one day, but it was too warm for me (like a bath) so stuck to my favourite pool - the ocean! There were trampoline type hammocks in the sea which if you could reach were lovely to lay on and relax. We didn't use them the first week we were there as they were very oily and full of algae, but on the second week one was cleaned and it was lovely to lay on. Service was a bit hit and miss, but it didn't massively impact on us - we were there to relax and had to remind ourselves that we weren't in any rush! The lunch restaurant Flying Fish, service did seem chaotic and slow - perhaps a bit more direction from management is required on this one.

The best part is 100% the view and room comfort in the Mahogany building's Luxury category.  For the price I'm not sure how it can be beat.  The bed and abundance of pillows were dreamy (literally and figuratively).  Food was notably better than our first visit in 2019 - a very pleasant and welcome surprise!  The beach was powder soft and pretty well devoid of seaweed.  I think I may have stepped on one rock all week while in the water.  We did notice a bit more wear and tear starting in some exteriors, but recognize too that this is part of Caribbean living.  Cleanliness though was spot on in the rooms and, for the most part, everywhere else. \n\nHaving been here before we expected some \""quirks\"" and accounted for them when deciding to return.  As anticipated, we experienced a few service missteps, but nothing to any degree that actually impacted our overall enjoyment.  I understand how some folks may be irked by a few things though.  For example, on our last morning we never got any coffee at breakfast despite having asked, two nights at Cerulean we finished dinner in about 45 minutes - while another night it took 2.5 hours, we mentioned that there were no batteries in our room's emergency lantern 3 times - and when we were given batteries on the day before we left, they were dead.  I'm pretty sure our housekeeper took the tips we left both for her AND for the person who refilled our fridge for the first few days, when a storm blew through all dinner reservations were switched to Mahogany but this was not communicated in any way.  While we did encounter a good number of staff who were warm and welcoming (Javon at Cerulean really stood out - well done young man!) there were certainly some who came across as abrupt and\u002For inconvenienced.  \n\nAgain, going in with the expectation of some \""quirks\"" helped to calibrate our expectations so we were not perturbed at all.

Me and my husband were in a completely different building than the other guests in our party.

We were told they had no other rooms at \""our level of stay\"" basically saying we didn't pay to be important there. \n\nAll-Inclusive implies you can get food whenever you would like. Nope. Only 1 place had breakfast and if you slept in... sorry about your bad luck, you had to wait. Which we did the first morning of our stay! Had to make a reservation each night to eat dinner. Our group had an e-mail from the manager stating you can only make reservations the morning of, so that is what we did. Every morning we were told that reservations were full and they could sit us at 8:30-9pm. Who wants to eat dinner then? Also, we were one of the first people up so who filled the reservations so fast?! On the fourth night of our stay a worker FINALLY told my husband and I \""oh no you can make reservations for three days in advance\"" cool ... \n\nA tropical storm came through and all the workers disappeared! When it ended our husbands all helped put the place back together moving couches etc... but that goes unrecognized by the hotel! That night we were not notified that our reservations for dinner were cancelled until we went to the restaurant to eat and they told us... they then had no availability anywhere else.... so we just don't eat?! \n\nOn the last night of our stay my husband and I came back from the Fish Fry early due to my anxiety and went to Mahogany, who historically the whole week had either underdone, overdone or bland food. Shout out to the Egg station though and the French toast ... that was the highlight of breakfasts! \n As soon as I asked if we could eat there the manager told me she didn't have anything until 8:30. I told my husband we would just purchase takeout since it was only us and it was 7pm. When she heard it was only the two of us she said she could sit us right away! How convenient... while we were there until 8:30 the WHOLE ENTIRE DINING ROOM was empty.... so why was I told she couldn't take the big party until 8:30? \n\nIt was a common occurrence no matter where we went and what upper management we spoke to they would talk nicely and then say \""Oh your with the 10 people\"" and their attitudes would immediately change. Horrible hospitality.  \n\nTowels weren't replaced in our room. There were times me and my husband used hand towels to dry off! \n\nPools closed at 8pm when normally adults would like to have a late night swim especially in the adult pool!

Management killed all things fun or joyful. No music was played during the day at all, where you would expect on an island that would be the smallest thing to bring life to such a dull hotel that had nothing of excitement except a half hour game of Bingo! Which my husband won a free cave trip, but when we called they had no availability during the two days we had left there!  \n\nThere were drug dealers on the \""private beach\"" that harassed us that the hotel did nothing to rectify. \n\nI got up to watch the sunrise one morning and didn't feel safe even walking through the \""resort\"" to get to the beach by myself. \n\nMy parents own a motel in NH and never in a million years would any guest, difficult or not, be treated how we were.

The hotel itself is set in a lovely location with beautiful sea views, clear waters and soft silky sand. The room we had was a luxury oceanfront suite in the Mahogony block, it was clean with a super comfy bed and daily minibar. Check in was quick, with a welcome drink and then a quick tour around the site then up to our room. The hotel itself was nice, quite compact so you don't have to walk far, with three evening restaurants, a beach bar, lunch\u002Fpool bar and two pools. \nThere are some mixed reviews on here, and we can see why. Yes, some of the staff are rude but most are OK (thank you to Robert at the beach bar, he was amazing!). The food was mixed (the a-la carte were great) but the buffet was quite limited in what it offered. Drinks were great, but menu's would be appreciated. The rum-shack was awesome, lots of seating and a real Bajan vibe with great rum-punches offered. There were two pools and lots of sunbeds available, but the pools were quite dirty and turned our swim costumes green.\nThere is also a kids club available, which our daughter attended a few times. They did a Halloween themed day and night which was exciting for the children. However, the overall management of the club did not feel safe as there were children as young as 5\u002F6 coming and going with no real sign in or out system. \nAs we had a late flight, we could store our luggage for free, and use the toilet\u002Fshower facilities block (cold showers). This was handy, but unfortunately after asking two times for a hairdryer nobody bothered to bring one to us. \nOverall, we had a good stay, but there are many improvements that could be made to make this a true 4* resort.

The chalets are absolutely gorgeous and well kept. We stayed at at several and my favourite are the Aqua\u2019s right on Georgian Bay. Everything was always clean and well stocked with the necessities.\n\nCheck-in and check-out was a breeze and the chalets are easy to find. The Aqua chalets are right around the corner from the village but in a perfect quiet spot across of the Giorgian Bay with a perfect sunrise at the crack of dawn and a beautiful sunset to conclude the day.\n\nThe dining room had a beautiful big wood table perfect for games and of course food! The furniture is extremely comfortable and well suited for the chalets. We enjoyed our time playing games and watching movies. The hot tub makes a great addition to our evenings accross of the Bay.\n\nAmazing location, staff, and experience. A perfect getaway for families and friends..

From a holistic take, everything about the BVC is perfection\u2014accommodations, activities, logistics and rec equipment, not to mention the professionalism and care of the hosts. This is easily my go-to when the serenity of nature is calling. I had some of the best sleep of my life while staying, and left feeling energized and ready to take on the world. The ultimate upshot?
